<PRE>Hallo Sri,

&gt;<i> I don't know what you say if an Installer is complicated? Maybe yes
</I>
Maybe the installer isn't complicated, but it _does_ make it complicated to
get a new program running and even _more_ complicated to get rid of it
again (I know, [most] every programmer doesn't want any user to do the
latter.),

&gt;<i> for developer, but it's make end users very happy that they can try a
</I>&gt;<i> new software without need any &quot;complicated&quot; configuration.
</I>
That's much more easily achieved by setting up the program in such a way
that it is sufficient to just &quot;throw it into&quot; some directory without the
need to &quot;install&quot; it - what the heck _does_ an installer do, anyway?
Cannot a program just simply _work_?
If the program needs any settings stored, it may do so at the usual places,
but it should definitely _not_ need that to run correctly, and it should not
save them without consent from the user ([ideally]).

(Just as a little aside: what are your thoughts about a person coming to
your home, going to your refrigerator to get him some food, laying himself
into your bed, littering your carpet with the remains of his feast...
It is _your_ home, after all, isn't it?
And just as well it is the _user's_ computer where your program runs, so it
is kind of a guest there, and should behave as a guest, not litter many
places with remains of it's presence as most Windows programs use to do -
I use to say, if you install Windows on &quot;your&quot; computer, it's no longer
_your_ computer - you hand it over to Microsoft, giving away the ownership.)

&gt;<i> I and other users can help you only to package MSEide. It's need hard
</I>&gt;<i> work only in first creating of installer project. Next time just build
</I>
If it's a helper program for _building_ the program, it doesn't have to get
outside the development machine; no user should have to bother with the
building process...

&gt;<i> or add/modify (if any changes in source file).
</I>
... especially not with source code modifications - unless it's
specifically a source code distribution. But even then, or rather
especially then, an installer is the last thing required. What's required
in this case is a well thought out Makefile (and maybe a configure script),
so the - knowledgable - user can see what's going on for himself.
NO installer (beyond the Makefile) - not on Linux, at least.

<PRE>Hallo Sri,

&gt;<i> I really strange why the &quot;Installer&quot; be a hot debate in this forum.
</I>
Because an installer is a critical piece of software that has the
capability of disrupting the target system in the worst case. Installers
for Windows software are known to do that at times.

&gt;<i> It's like the debate to make a program with a text mode or GUI mode,
</I>&gt;<i> and it's up to the ability of programmer and the habit itself.
</I>
It's about whether to try to hide crucial things from the customer, be it
information or activities. An installer program cannot take into account
all the many possible setups user's systems may have; for Linux, it cannot
even take into account all the many packaging methods alone, for Windows,
it has to cope with half a dozen system versions, any number of hardware
constellations and some different versions of rights management. Most
installers around these days - to not say all of them, as I don't know but
a few - do many things contrary to system rules, if present.

&gt;<i> Installer created for the user / consumer. It depends on how the
</I>&gt;<i> number of users who use our products, and type / user capability. Very
</I>&gt;<i> funny if we make an application to the kids, but the installation
</I>&gt;<i> process is very complicated and had to call / pay the third party,
</I>&gt;<i> only to install our product.
</I>
An installer is a very complex piece of software - it has to cope with many
widely variable conditions, and still be able to judge them right and
derive the right actions from the information accessible about them.
If it misjudges one condition, it might make the installed software useless
or malfunctioning, or it may interfere with another program or even some
system function.
So, an installer program can usually only cover most &quot;standard&quot; setups,
i.e. configurations where the user didn't do a lot of personalisation.
Even then it may fail, perhaps because of some special requirement of some
hardware component or because of a recent system update.

&gt;<i> Programmer / developer is free to determine whether he should make the
</I>
That's right, of course. But if most decided for &quot;not&quot;, why'd you bother?
On the other hand, if there's a utility available purporting to do all the
details &quot;right&quot; that had to be explained painstakingly otherwise, most
programmers probabely will opt for this as they thoroughly dislike writing
anything akin to documentation (that can be coded in any way) usually.

&gt;<i> installer or not. Depending on the ability of prospective users and
</I>&gt;<i> the number of user too. When I create a project for a some company
</I>&gt;<i> (less than 10), I did not make the installer, because I immediately
</I>&gt;<i> install it by myself. But when the companis which use my product more
</I>&gt;<i> growth, without the installer my product could not sell. Because the
</I>&gt;<i> trend of more people choose the automatic rather than manual.
</I>
Yes, and this trend is caused by the availability of installation software
that purports to perform the whole process without having to know what to
do - people are lazy and don't want to put effort into learning new things.
The problems only arise later, if the installation process doesn't fail in
the first place. (If it does, _this_ piece of software will probabely be
deemed unusable and removed [if possible] immediately.) Later on, if a
problem arises during use, there's not enough knowledge available to do any
kind of repair, requiring the user / maintainer to request help from the
supporting personnel or even the implementor. And the lack of knowledge
leads to neglect of maintenance, which also furthers the probability of
problems.

&gt;<i> And I think the installer topics not to debate. In the world of
</I>&gt;<i> software developer, almost all big companies have decided to make the
</I>&gt;<i> installer for their product. Are they that have a lot of experts human
</I>&gt;<i> is stupid, or inappropriate to make that decision?
</I>
They had to cope with the unwieldiness of the most common platform they
provide software for. The opaque structures used in Windows - registry,
DLLs - and the lack of a common structure in early versions made it
difficult to get more complex systems running. And above that came the lack
of information of users by the system provider, who decided to keep them
unknowing about the system setup and workings and rather promote the
&quot;ease of use&quot; &quot;working&quot; with it. Well, not working - playing, fiddling
around. (It wasn't so bad in Windows' early days, installers were quite
rare then.)

&gt;<i> should strive to be elected as Pascal programming lessons in schools
</I>&gt;<i> and universities. Why Delphi, VB, VC, Java, Python, etc famous?
</I>&gt;<i> Because the IDE is much learned on college or campuses. Is
</I>
There's a very simple reason for that: C is an american development, while
Pascal was developped in Switzerland. Now you just need to compare, where
more people live - USA or Switzerland?
Delphi doesn't count - Delphi isn't very popular any more outside the
Pascal community, and that's mostly restricted to Europe
VB is BASIC, also purely USAnian, VC is purely C, Java and Python are
C-like, as are many other popular (so called &quot;scripting&quot;) languages.

&gt;<i> MSEide+MSEgui need the installer? Depending on the Martin who decided,
</I>                                                 ^^^#
&gt;<i> because he is owner of this project. And he knows very well the
</I>
Exactly. He's the only one to decide what to use for _his_ project, as is
anyone else for his.
But as this is no &quot;free-standing&quot; project, one should think some about its
usefulness - after all, the effort could be put elsewhere if there's no use
for it.
And that's why I started this discussion, mostly paraphrasing a discussion
in some (Linux) usenet group I regularly attend.

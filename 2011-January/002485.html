</I>As I wrote before, I think installers for MSEide+MSEgui are a good idea if 
they are of good quality. I simply don't want to make and maintain them by 
myself because it is work and not absolutely necessary. I don't think that it 
is possible to earn enough money from MSEide+MSEgui at the moment that it is 
worthwhile for me to do that job.
I am still awaiting the payment of EUR 70000 (uhmm, even 80000 because of the 
current exchange rate EUR -&gt; CHF) so that I can start the documentation 
process BTW. ;-)

&gt;<i> For MSEide+MSEgui, if you want to be famous in the coming years,

Agreed but it will barely happen.

&gt;<i> Why Delphi, VB, VC, Java, Python, etc famous? 
</I>&gt;<i> Because the IDE is much learned on college or campuses. Is
</I>&gt;<i> MSEide+MSEgui need the installer? Depending on the Martin who decided,
</I>&gt;<i> because he is owner of this project. And he knows very well the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of making this project. If only for the experiment, even now
</I>&gt;<i> already is enough, and I (we) are satisfied can use it for production.
</I>&gt;<i> If there are any other purpose, I think he needs to say his goals
</I>&gt;<i> clearly, so we can decide what we say in this forum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Anybody can write here what he/she wants as long there are no personal attacks 
and as long there is a friendly tone.
My current plans for MSEide+MSEide in near future are mainly optimizations in 
IDE and library and to watch what happens in the MSEide+MSEgui community.

Martin

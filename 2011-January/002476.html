</I>&gt;<i> Well - tell me _where_ &quot;danger is less than 0.001%&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot talk about Windows - Windows is especially fragile in this
</I>&gt;<i> respect.
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot talk about Linux either. Its multitude of distributions makes
</I>&gt;<i> the variablity of those settings so broad that it's nearly impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> get any serious adjustment right on most, and none at all on everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> Could you talk about Mac OSX? Maybe, because that is  
</I>&gt;<i> one-vendor-one-setup,
</I>&gt;<i> and Aple has sufficient influence on its users to have them comply to  
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> strict, if not stringent, rules.

Me mean a particular installation on a particalar worlkplace for
particalur task/need, not breakin any public ditros :)
One more example - switching FRSYNC &amp; OIDS on for PostgerSQL (add a few
lines /etc/postgresq/postgresql.conf) when instailing updates/fixes to our
program complex since the complex needs that as long as other app don't
suffer from these setting (a bit slower but much more reliable). Why do
installer performs this ? Because our tech support stuff would hang
theirself doing hundreds of such operations, or will kill me :) Also
installer may be run remotely by a single shell command so updating
(hunderds of changes) of our complex is peformed fully automatically as 1)
uploading to work places via FTP &amp; 2) loginning to workplaces with
TELNET/SHH then becoming ROOT (via Perl/Expect telnet emulator) then
running the installer. All in cycle until all workplace are applied. A few
keypresses instead of many days of boring work of tech support. A lot of
time freed for MSE* &amp; self education &amp; even politic debates &amp; thus more
entertaining life :) Just imagine loginning then applying hundreds of
changes to 165 workplaces !!! So, proper &amp; smart installer package is a
great deal :)

<PRE>I'll humour you with one more response...

&gt;<i> The database server is a sparate application, and it should be recognized
</I>&gt;<i> as such. In any case, any database needs thorough maintenance, which it
</I>&gt;<i> certainly will not get if &quot;installed&quot; behind the back of the user.
</I>
And here you are WRONG again. Lets see... Apps that use MS-Access - not
user is required to &quot;maintenance&quot; the database. Mozilla Thunderbird and
Firefox uses SQLLite databases to store info. NO user required database
maintenance. Firebird in embedded mode (and even as full server) doesn't
need maintenance. Applications that use Paradox databases - again no
user maintenance is required.

&gt;<i> No. They could create it themselves if their user is allowed to do so (most
</I>
OK, now I know you are just playing the fool!! Our applications get
deployed in school and centers. They are mostly run by ex Science and
Maths teachers. Thye know NOTHING about computers, let alone how to
install a database server, run DDL scripts to create a database etc...
They just know.. click the icon on the dekstop.


&gt;<i> _WHAT_? The _user_ of an application has a need to _FIND_ it?
</I>
Read the previous paragraph. Our clients/users are ex-teachers. Many of
them are 50+ years old, and have near ZERO experience with computers.
Some don't even know what a &quot;desktop&quot; or icon is, or which button on the
mouse must be clicked. So now you expect them to drop to a console
window, CD through directories and execute applications. Yeah right! Not
even our IT staff at our office knows how to do that on Linux - they are
Windows users.


&gt;<i> ... but shows very nicely how people using computers are dumbed down to
</I>&gt;<i> mere mouse button clickers.
</I>
Yes, they have a job to do! They don't need or want to know the file
system hierarchy, or the difference between a Windows DOS box or a Linux
(bash) console window. They simply want to teach students Maths or
Science using our product.


&gt;<i> No, it is not - it needs a knowledgable developper in the first and most
</I>&gt;<i> important place. And such one doesn't need any installer at all.
</I>
So why does Delphi, MS Visual Studio, Qt Creator, Java SDK etc all come
with installations and pre-built binaries? Stop talking bullsh*t. I've
said enough on this topic.

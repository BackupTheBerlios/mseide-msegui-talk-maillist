<PRE>Hallo IvankoB,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - add files to execute before/after installation
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What for?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adjusting system,
</I>
I.e. mangling with system internals until previously flawlessly working
software gets disrupted? The way Windows software overthrows working
configurations, even replaces system constituents by older or flawed
versions?
No, thank you.

&gt;<i> Adjusting system, checking &amp; editing external configs,
</I>
What &quot;external configs&quot; have to be &quot;checked&quot; and &quot;edited&quot; that the software
or its user couldn't &quot;check&quot; and &quot;edit&quot; themselves? If there's no
configuration file available, the program should use viable defaults built
into it. There's not very much beyond a program that crashes if it cannot
find a &quot;suitable&quot; configuration that I dislike.
No, thank you.

&gt;<i> Adjusting system, checking &amp; editing external configs, restarting
</I>&gt;<i> daemons,
</I>
_What_ daemons does a newly to install program should have to fiddle with -
except, maybe, if it's one itself? And even in the latter case, it shouldn't
bring down its elder without the user's knowledge - after all, it could
disrupt some important activity it just performs.
Yes, that's a reason why I _dislike_ the Debian approach to system upgrades,
and any unattended updating method at all. I just wonder why there's not
yet surfaced a fake update to some system that installs some spy service,
backdoor, server for illegal activity or some such. But maybe there is
already, but no one's yet recognized it, like the &quot;stuxnet&quot; worm...
There are so many &quot;opportunties&quot; for bad people - and their number keeps
growing fast. You will soon be able to &quot;download&quot; the latest motor
controller update to your car - could be interesting if - when - someone
provides a &quot;specially tuned&quot; variant that, e.g., makes it running
backwards...
No, thank you.

&gt;<i> daemons, creating databases &amp; users, downloading extra files, etc...
</I>
Well, basically the same as above applies here, too.
No, thank you.

&gt;<i> Using the extreme power of bash/awk/sed/perl.
</I>
Provide support scripts that the user may call on his own - then he has the
chance to check them before they can wreak havoc on his setup, at least.

&gt;<i> DEB package's &quot;preinst&quot; &amp; &quot;postinst&quot; allow to make the package a large  
</I>&gt;<i> program complex :)
</I>
A complex, opaque bunch that does unknown and sometimes even disruptive
things to their user's machines. Although the processes often work without
causing noticeable problems, there are cases when something doesn't work
right afterwards, or things don't work any more the packet shouldn't have
touched at all, or even the system won't start again altogether.
Packetized updating does have its problems in any case - I found out yet
again, as I've just updated two machines (Arch Linux, not Debian), where
quite some subtle (and some not-so-subtle) issues arose. It took me quite
some time to readjust most of them, some only surfaced during early use,
when I couldn't address them, and some I just simply haven't seen yet.

If you present these issues to an unknowledgable user, what do you think he
will do and say?

With Windows, the most prominent measure is &quot;reinstall&quot; - loosing most, if
not all of your personal setup. And that's why most Windows users have
already resigned and use all of their software &quot;as is&quot; - forgoing the
purpose of all those delicately engineered settings that could be used to
adjust the workings to their needs, just using them in the crudest way
possible, because the time spent for personalization will be lost in time...

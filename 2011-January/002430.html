<PRE>Hallo Graeme,

&gt;<i> Have you actually written a program that got deployed? Many apps these
</I>
Depends on what you count as &quot;deployed&quot;. And to whom you want to have it
deployed. The so called embedded systems I wrote software for cannot be
&quot;installed&quot; by such software anyway, and most of the other programs in
daily use at various sites I wrote don't need an installer, either because
they manage their settings themselves or they are maintained by a
knowledgable person.

&gt;<i> days need a database server, the installer can even install such a
</I>
The database server is a sparate application, and it should be recognized
as such. In any case, any database needs thorough maintenance, which it
certainly will not get if &quot;installed&quot; behind the back of the user.

&gt;<i> database server for them. Such database apps would require a database to
</I>&gt;<i> exist.
</I>
No. They could create it themselves if their user is allowed to do so (most
Linux programs using a database I'm aware of can) or they should come with
the information that and how a database should to be instituted for them,
if the user of the program is not allowed to do so himself.

&gt;<i> exist. The installer can create such a database. For the user to run the

</I>
_WHAT_? The _user_ of an application has a need to _FIND_ it? Do you also
have &quot;the need to find&quot; your newly purchased refrigerator within your home?
That's ridiculous...

... but shows very nicely how people using computers are dumbed down to
mere mouse button clickers. Just click on the icon, and your computer does
everything for you. You don't even need to think anymore...
(And you _shouldn't_ know what &quot;I&quot; - the software writer - did behind your
back...?)

&gt;<i> easy to find location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The list goes on and on....
</I>
Yeah, and it shows in the way people talk about &quot;their&quot; computers - and not
only computers any more, but also their phones and other processor
controlled gadgets.

&gt;<i> It's only very small utility/toy apps that just have a single executable
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;just works&quot;. Even MSEide (as Martin ships it) is pretty useless on
</I>&gt;<i> it's own. It needs the MSEgui source code or at least the compile units
</I>&gt;<i> of them, before MSEide can be used for anything. It needs project
</I>&gt;<i> templates to get a project started, it needs the FPC compiler etc... So
</I>&gt;<i> even Martin's &quot;simple deployment idea&quot; is flawed.
</I>
No, it is not - it needs a knowledgable developper in the first and most
important place. And such one doesn't need any installer at all.

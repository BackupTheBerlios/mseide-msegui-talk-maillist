<PRE>I really strange why the &quot;Installer&quot; be a hot debate in this forum.
It's like the debate to make a program with a text mode or GUI mode,
and it's up to the ability of programmer and the habit itself.

Installer created for the user / consumer. It depends on how the
number of users who use our products, and type / user capability. Very
funny if we make an application to the kids, but the installation
process is very complicated and had to call / pay the third party,
only to install our product.

Programmer / developer is free to determine whether he should make the
installer or not. Depending on the ability of prospective users and
the number of user too. When I create a project for a some company
(less than 10), I did not make the installer, because I immediately
install it by myself. But when the companis which use my product more
growth, without the installer my product could not sell. Because the
trend of more people choose the automatic rather than manual.

And I think the installer topics not to debate. In the world of
software developer, almost all big companies have decided to make the
installer for their product. Are they that have a lot of experts human
is stupid, or inappropriate to make that decision?

For MSEide+MSEgui, if you want to be famous in the coming years,
should strive to be elected as Pascal programming lessons in schools
and universities. Why Delphi, VB, VC, Java, Python, etc famous?
Because the IDE is much learned on college or campuses. Is
MSEide+MSEgui need the installer? Depending on the Martin who decided,
because he is owner of this project. And he knows very well the
purpose of making this project. If only for the experiment, even now
already is enough, and I (we) are satisfied can use it for production.
If there are any other purpose, I think he needs to say his goals
clearly, so we can decide what we say in this forum.

Thanks
Wahono

<PRE>Thank you to all who have responded to the topic &#8220;installer&#8221;.

A lot of good advice and support, there is also a scathing critique.
But unfortunately my English is bad, so I can not respond one by one
quickly. To write long sentences like this, I had to use google
translate. :)

But I can conclude, that most participants of this forum is pure
programmers, so that way of thinking is very technical, and rarely use
the concept of marketing.

If I do not just programmers, but I'm also a businessman. No matter
what I do/build, whether it's open source projects or commercial
projects, must make money. How to make money in the community, is to
invite many people as possible to join in the community. Look at Mark
Zuckerberg the young billionaire, because he could gather more people
to join the facebook community, and many other examples of the rich
man from the community.

What I offer to Martin is how the community MSEide+MSEgui growing more
and more. Have you estimated how many users of MSEide+MSEgui in the
world? Probably not more than 500 people. In my country (with a
population of around 240 million), the FPC and Lazarus community very
much, but serious users of MSEide+MSEgui probably my only one, it's
me. When I advised them to use MSEide + MSEgui, they always reasoned
confused to use it, or the initial view when first trying less
memorable (installation, the IDE is not structured layout when it
first opened, etc.).

If this community very much, I am sure, the documentation process
becomes very easy. If now only a few people who are active in this
forum, even this most programmers are mostly pure lazy in making the
documentation (including me).

And I also had to say to Martin, I think Martin is too long live in
programmer world, so his mind set is leading to coding, and about the
concept of marketing / business is not so bothered.

What I try to contribute to this project, is to make this project
become great and famous to many communities. So the struggle of Martin
more than 11 years would get result, in addition to satisfaction at
work but also the money that flowed into Martin account. If I just
hope I can advertise my product to the community (as in
www.msegui.org), so that the products I create can generate a lot of
money too for me.

I was often surprised by the open source community, who rarely thinks
about the business, they are only concerned with fame. And in addition
to their famous can also generate more money than they were a good
person to share knowledge and results of their work.

One more, if many say MSEide + MSEgui only to programmers, so it does
not need installer interesting. So I said, all great programmers come
from ordinary people who try a programming (IDE), then they go into it
seriously, thus becoming a great programmer and famous. Installer as
the face in humans, which makes the first impression that others may
be interested or not.

I will create a new project on sourceforge.net to upload my installer.
Please you download and try it, and use for your project if you feel
like it. If anyone is interested to develop this project, please post
here and let's develop this intaller to be more better.

And I also give a little sample project for MSEide + MSEgui installer
for Windows. If Martin are interested I will help to complete it.

Wahono

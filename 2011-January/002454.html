<PRE>Hallo Graeme,

&gt;<i> And here you are WRONG again. Lets see... Apps that use MS-Access - not

</I>
Well - at least for any useful uses of Paradox (though probabely also
applying to the others) this is certainly not the case. The Mozilla
program's databases - very small assemblages of data, for that matter - can
become quite thoroughly garbled at times if the user acts careless. You can
easily loose all your saved addresses, e.g. At least earlier versions
produced garbled databases if used extensively.
I cannot say anything on MS Access, though I heard weird things about it,
even amounting to the opinion that it was unviable for serious use.

&gt;<i> &gt; No. They could create it themselves if their user is allowed to do so

</I>
Thanks for your appreciation. But you're totally wrong. I'm mostly deranged
and tired of what I often have to repair for people seduced to the opinion
that they could easily do something complex with their machine they do not
understand the consequences of.

&gt;<i> deployed in school and centers. They are mostly run by ex Science and
</I>&gt;<i> Maths teachers. Thye know NOTHING about computers, let alone how to
</I>
Yes, that is a big problem, and a serious error in addition. It just simply
isn't so. Especially teachers should have at least some background in what
they teach and be able to perform minimal tasks at it. Would you think a
chemistry teacher who cannot demonstrate any reaction to the pupils would
be able to teach them chemistry? Or a mathematics teacher who cannot even
calculate?
But a computer &quot;science&quot; teacher who doesn't know how a computer works is
perfectly acceptable, no?
Or, if these are applications for administrative data processing for the
school - how could this be done even marginally right if the operating
personnel doesn't know what they're operating?

&gt;<i> &gt; _WHAT_? The _user_ of an application has a need to _FIND_ it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Read the previous paragraph. Our clients/users are ex-teachers. Many of
</I>&gt;<i> them are 50+ years old, and have near ZERO experience with computers.
</I>
Fine, that's a real chance for them to get up to date. (BTW, I'm over 50
also.) There's _nothing_ that hinders anyone however old to learn something
new, if he's interested in it. And to use something seriously, you _need_
to know it well, and need to know some basics of it's working at least.
Even housewifes need to know _where_ they store their things for cooking
and baking and maintaining the home, and they even need to know what to
store in the refrigerator and what to avoid putting into it.

&gt;<i> Some don't even know what a &quot;desktop&quot; or icon is, or which button on the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse must be clicked. So now you expect them to drop to a console
</I>&gt;<i> window, CD through directories and execute applications. Yeah right! Not
</I>
Did I write that? Not to say they couldn't learn that, but they should have
a notion of _where_ something's put, and _that_ there are such ordering
criteria like &quot;directories&quot; (I _don't_ like the term &quot;folder&quot;, though it's
even better than the german pseudo translation used) and &quot;files&quot;, which may
be further categorized into executables, text and so on. And aren't there
copious numbers of applications striving to visualize these connections?

&gt;<i> even our IT staff at our office knows how to do that on Linux - they are
</I>&gt;<i> Windows users.
</I>
And on &quot;their&quot; Windows machines, they don't even know how to use the
explorer, right? ];-&gt;
Well, Windows is especially bad in so far as it even _actively_ attempts to
hide its structure from the user, displaying &quot;virtual&quot; folders which don't
exist but in the &quot;imagination&quot; of the system...
Windows 7 purportedly even lets programs write into non existing
directories, diverting the data to someplace else, so that the files cannot
even be found again by their very producers. Now, _that_ is user friendly...

&gt;<i> &gt; ... but shows very nicely how people using computers are dumbed down to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mere mouse button clickers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, they have a job to do! They don't need or want to know the file
</I>
Yes, and the most important precondition to make your job _right_ is to
_know_ your _tools_! That means they _need_ to know the structures they're
working with, lest they might wreak havoc on them and cause loss of much of
their achievements.

&gt;<i> system hierarchy, or the difference between a Windows DOS box or a Linux
</I>&gt;<i> (bash) console window. They simply want to teach students Maths or
</I>&gt;<i> Science using our product.
</I>
Which they bluntly cannot do ignorant about their tools.

&gt;<i> So why does Delphi, MS Visual Studio, Qt Creator, Java SDK etc all come
</I>&gt;<i> with installations and pre-built binaries?
</I>
How can I know? They didn't need to, although for Delphi, I know that the
installer does a whole lot of writing entries to the registry, which it
even tries to hide from the user as to make it difficult to change the
location of any files it copies to the system or to add or remove some
functionality. They seem to do this to disable the user to cleanly remove
the application, to augment or relocate it, and of course to copy it to
another machine - even if that's a replacement machine for a dying one.
(Did you ever have to reinstitute a heavily customized Delphi?)

And that seems to be the main reason for such stuff, as I see it - to keep
the customer unknowing and make him dependent on the vendor and its (his?
No, there's seldom a real person involved anymore) &quot;service&quot;.

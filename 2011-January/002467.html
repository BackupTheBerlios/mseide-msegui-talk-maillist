&gt;<i> My experience is that the possibilities to make most efficient user interfaces 
</I>&gt;<i> were limited by tools which strictly use standard GUI widgets and no 
</I>&gt;<i> specialized components, code and settings in GUI part.
</I>
The MGM implementation I created for tiOPF is able to support VCL, LCL
and fpGUI without hassle. Other toolkits can be applied easily. I can
say with certainty that we have not experienced any limitations because
we only use standard gui components, in fact it is rather the other way
round. We now have more flexibility in what components we can use in our
UI, because normally there are a lot more standard components in various
gui toolkits than there are db-aware ones. This is even true in the case
of MSEgui (Widget + Edit + Dialog component palette vs DBe component
palette).

What is also really nice is that most of the MGM code is actually
non-gui code, so it is all unit tested as well. Again something you
can't do with the workings of db-aware components. Even switching your
application from one gui toolkit to another will be a trivial task.
Because the way you bind BO properties to gui controls are uniform in
every toolkit our MGM implementation supports.

Our MGM implementation also has design time support, for those die-hard
RAD-style developers. But I would recommend developers not use than, and
instead creating the binding in code - after all, it's one line per
component.


&gt;<i> Disagreed. It is absolutely possible to make a clean and easy maintainable 
</I>&gt;<i> application structure with the RAD possibilities of MSEide+MSEgui.
</I>
In all my time of programming, I have yet to see such an application in
Delphi or Lazarus. :)

The other problem with RAD-style development is that in promotes the
idea of adding business rules into the GUI (forms) via the many event
handlers. This also reduces the chances of being able to reuse such
event handlers (which often contain business rules). With our MGM
implementation you can create a customized descendant of any standard
mediator. Such a mediator never lives in a Form unit, and thus easily
allows it to be reused. We have many such cases especially for
customizing grid painting or setting our preferred preferences on a
grid. All the developer needs to do is simply drop a grid on a form -
they have no need to customize any of the grid's properties, because the
custom mediator for a grid component does all that for you. So if we
want to change the behaviour or look of all our grids in our
application, we only need to modify one grid mediator.

Anyway, judging from your ideas and designs in MSEgui, I am sure you did
a better job than Delphi or Lazarus - though I would still refrain from
using db-aware RAD-style development for any of our apps.

So I think it is safe to say we agree to disagree. ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> NO. Some parts in FPC and Lazarus (eg: the RTL) is LGPL with a static
</I>&gt;<i> linking exception. Meaning you can use that code inside your application
</I>&gt;<i> (not a external library), and still do not require to make your
</I>&gt;<i> applications GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe MSEgui has a similar license to the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&quot;
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your 
choice,
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms
and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a 
module
which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this
library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you 
are
not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
statement from your version.
&quot;
The exception especially means that you don't need to provide a possibility 
that the user can use  a newer version of the library, I.E you don't need to 
distribute linkable object modules of your software as LGPL requires:
&quot;
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
&quot;
Copy pasting library code in a distributed non open source project is not 
allowed.

&gt;<i> Lazarus IDE (and I believe MSEide) are GPL applications  (different
</I>&gt;<i> license to the gui library parts) - they must always be free and open,
</I>&gt;<i> even for derived work based on their code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Correct, MSEide is GPL.

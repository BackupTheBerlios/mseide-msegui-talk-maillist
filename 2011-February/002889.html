<PRE>Also:

===========================
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of  
it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete  
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed  
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for  
software interchange.

As is apparent from the following provisions of the LGPL, the distribution  
of source code of a library standing alone is more restricted under the  
LGPL than under the GPL: when the executable or binary code is distributed  
standing alone, it must be accompanied by the source code.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a  
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code  
 from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source  
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along  
with the object code.

The LGPL, like the GPL, does permit the distribution of the source code by  
offering it on equivalent terms as the executable, such as on an FTP site,  
if the binary code is so offered.
===========================

Does the above mean that installation packages of MSEgui apps should also  
include the whole MSEgui PAS-sources (exactly like GPLed MSEide matters  
with LGPLed MSEgui) ?
That's application binaries (using MSEgui, for instance) should be ALWAYS  
accompanied by MSEgui sources as well - separation (or redirection to URLs  
of Inetnet servers ) is not allowed, correct ? And we should include FULL  
(huge !) sources of FreePascal as well if any of its unit is USEd by the  
appication. And MSEide+MSEgui should aslo include full LGPLed FPC RTL +  
FCL sources :) In a long usage chain, it would finally look like a tall  
upside-down pyramide of tons of MBytes size :)

I never work or see a TDataset instance. My application code *only*
works with Objects. eg: TCustomerList, TCustomer, TAddressList,
TAddress, TCountry, TTransaction (an accounting transaction) etc.


&gt;<i> If you don't use TDataSet then you do not uses DBGrid, right?
</I>&gt;<i> So which component - community maintained - I should use, StringGrid?
</I>
I find DB-aware versions of the same non-db component, just another
place where bugs can creep in. Why have two of each component? Db and
no-DB versions? Also, there are many more non-db components around (at
least this is true in Delphi), so why can't we use those too in a DB
component.

This is the type of questions I asked my self. I then went ahead and
designed MGM which allows me to make any component (GUI widget)
&quot;object-aware&quot; without having to create custom descendants of those
components.
MGM uses two design patterns (Mediator and Observer) to make any
component object-aware. The updating process in 2 directions as well.
Update the GUI, and the related object is updated. Update the object and
all GUI components that observe it are updated. All automatically.

So yes, I use a StringGrid to display grid related data. And as I have
shown earlier, I can set that up with 4 lines of code. Inline editing is
also possible, but again I prefer a dedicated &quot;edit form&quot; to edit my
data. My users prefer this too. Otherwise I could just as well having
given them an Excel spreadsheet instead of my application. They don't
want to edit ugly grids directly.


&gt;<i> It is a pain use it!
</I>
Not at all. fpGUI's grids can have many customizations applied to them
too, so that they don't look like a plain ugly grid. Also in the case of
grids, if I wanted to find out what object is selected (again I only
work with objects, not grid cell text or TDataset etc.), I simply ask
the Mediator that manages that grid, to return the selected object.

eg:
procedure TMyListForm.EditDataObject(Sender: TObject);
var
  lData: TMyDataObject;
  mediator: TtiMediatorView;
begin
  mediator := FMediator.FindByComponent(MyStringGrid).Mediator;
  lData := med.SelectedObject;
  EditData(lData); // launch an edit form to edit lData
end;

FMediator is a TFormMediator which manages the whole form. Each
individual GUI component has a mediator too - the TFormMediator creates
and manages those individual &quot;property&quot; mediators for me, so I don't
have to worry about that. So in the code above I simply ask the Form
Mediator to return the Mediator for the StringGrid in question. I then
ask that StringGrid Mediator to return the selected object.

The above code is pretty much how all my form units look like. They
don't contain much code, because forms are really just a way to
visualize your data. All the inner workings of my business rules are
coded inside the business objects. So too all the loading and saving of
data to a database is managed by tiOPF. That also means most of my code
is non-gui code, thus I can easily unit test my code too - resulting in
much less defects/bugs.


&gt;<i> Many classes is more complex than less. Many classes with long names
</I>&gt;<i> is more complex even more.
</I>
Sorry, I don't see it like that at all. Objects are there to structure
your programming, just like Records were there to structure your code in
Turbo Pascal days. Use the features or the language your are programming in.

In your list of objects you have a TDataSet and can transform each
register in an object or you have a real list of objects without a
TDataSet?

&gt;<i> You too have many similar cases in your current software. Just look at
</I>&gt;<i> menu entries. Many many different names for each TMenuItem instance?
</I>&gt;<i> :) &#160;I really don't see what you are confused or complaining about,
</I>&gt;<i> sorry.
</I>
The objects created by IDE that are not part of my business rules I
simply ignore them.
But I understood what you said.

&gt;&gt;<i> I prefer write my own SQL (for search). Just CRUD I do with something like OPF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same here, even for CRUD. I often load master/detail relationships
</I>&gt;<i> with a single visitor and a single sql statement. Yet the resulting
</I>&gt;<i> data are various List objects and Data objects.
</I>
If you don't use TDataSet then you do not uses DBGrid, right?
So which component - community maintained - I should use, StringGrid?
It is a pain use it!

&gt;&gt;<i> I talk about an explosion of names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither Delphi nor FPC has a limitation on the amount of names you may
</I>&gt;<i> use for classes, identifiers etc. So what's the problem? Large
</I>&gt;<i> applications have large numbers of objects and identifier names, this
</I>&gt;<i> is normal. Your IDE of choice might just auto-generate those names for
</I>&gt;<i> you without you actually paying attention to them. Easy examples of
</I>&gt;<i> this are TMenuItem instances or TField instances.
</I>
Many classes is more complex than less. Many classes with long names
is more complex even more.
Classes and objects managed by the IDE is not a problem of programmer.
I have concern just with my objects of business.

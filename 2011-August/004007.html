</I>
I use a reporting engine (also in tiOPF) that doesn't require TDataset,
but does support it. We use it to generates reports directly from
Objects. There are other reporting engines like ReportBuilder for Delphi
that can also report directly from Objects or TDataset.

As I mentioned before, tiOPF also supports data as a TDataset
descendant, so if you really must use TDataset, it is available to you.


&gt;<i> But to do this you need to implement procedures for each event, eg to
</I>&gt;<i> a TEdit you implements the OnChange event, etc)?
</I>
Correct, but the MGM implementation already does this all for you. It
also allows you to decide what events you would like to act upon, but
supplies logical defaults eg: TEdit will use OnChange, some other widget
might use OnFocusLost, OnTabChanged etc.

Then you also get more tricky cases like TComboBox. There could be many
ways you want to use that component. eg:

 - TCombobox must edit a property and simply supply static enum options
   eg:  Gender:  Male or Female

 - TCombobox must edit a object property and supply a dynamic list
   of options: eg:  Country:  a list of TCountry objects

 - TCombobox must be edit a text property, but the user can
   enter new values or select from a list. An editable ComboBox.

 etc.

Again, tiOPF's MGM supplies all these already, with very easy to use
interfaces to hook up the data.


&gt;<i> I create my business object; call the procedure that convert Object to
</I>&gt;<i> Form (widgets); and the inverse is true for save the data of widgets.
</I>&gt;<i> All this using RTTI.
</I>
I quickly found that you can't always use RTTI for everything. By
default MGM uses RTTI though. eg: Sometimes a property must be forced as
Public instead of Published for whatever reason. So RTTI can't access
that public property, but this is not a problem for tiOPF's MGM. Simply
create a custom mediator descendant, override the property name use use
(thus not RTTI, but references directyl). Register that mediator, and
away you go.

I have also extended the functionality of RTTI functions in tiOPF. So
you can extract a property value use &quot;property paths&quot;, which standard
Delphi and FPC's RTTI functions can't do.
eg:
var
  lValue: string
begin
  lValue := tiGetProperty(SomeObject, 'Customer.Address.Country');

This will use the 'Customer' property of SomeObject, then query the
'Address' property of the Customer object, then query the 'Country'
property of the Address object for its value. nil values anywhere in the
property path is checked for and handled.


&gt;<i> But I have two questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A DataSet with 1000 registers is not more lean that 1000 instances
</I>&gt;<i> of objects?
</I>
I don't understand &quot;1000 registers&quot;. I can say that tiOPF's MGM adds
very little overhead to you code. I think it's actually much less than
DB-aware components (which contain a lot more code than MGM does). The
benefits of MGM, for use at least, far outweighs the usage of DB-aware
components.


&gt;<i> 2. You need to write code to register a Mediator with a widget or you
</I>&gt;<i> just put the widget on the form and the framework do this for you?
</I>
You would follow these steps:

 1.  Drop a widget on the form
 2.  Hook up the widget to the property of the data object in question.
     This is usually done in the OnCreate event handle, but you can do
     it elsewhere too, like in the OnShow etc. Or if you use Tabs style
     interface, you can use OnTabPageChange, reducing the mediator usage
     only to the tabs the user is viewing.

Before I showed how to setup a StringGrid to observe a list of objects.
Here is how you would setup edit widgets for editing properties of a
single Object.

  if not Assigned(FMediator) then
  begin
    FMediator := TtiModelMediator.Create(self);
    FMediator.AddProperty('TaxCode', edtTaxCode);
    FMediator.AddProperty('Description', edtName1);
    FMediator.AddProperty('Rate', edtTaxRate);
    FMediator.AddProperty('IsActive', cbIsActive);
  end;
  FMediator.Subject := Data;  // Data is the object we want to edit
  FMediator.Active := True;


Here we have setup 4 edit widgets. 2 TextEdit widgets, 1 FloatEdit
widget, and 1 CheckBox widget.

Now say you drop a TEdit on a form, and normally change a few properties
so it behaves or looks correctly to what you want. You can create a
custom mediator that sets those properties. The simply register that
mediator for a specific type. So now you don't have no set those
properties every time you use a TEdit widget, the custom mediator will
do all that for you.


But wait, there's more! :-) What about Input Validation! Any TtiObject
descendant (eg: TCustomer) has a IsValid(...) method, by default
returning True. MGM's mediators call that method automatically as data
gets changed. As soon as the user entered invalid data, the widget's
background color changes, and the Hint property is replaced with a error
message. Clearly indicating to the user that more action is required
before they can save there changes. As soon as valid data is entered,
the background color and hint value will reset to what they originally were.


So as you can see, there is actually a lot of things tiOPF's MGM does
for you. And of course, all default options and behaviours are
configurable by the developer. All this application code is portable
between VCL, LCL and fpGUI too. As I mentioned before, MSEgui support is
on my todo list already.

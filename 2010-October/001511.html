One can assume that all what must be done can be done with MSEgui in an
efficient and elegant manner. ;-)

I don't think that writing documentation is least rewarding and least
productive. While writing documentation one often finds design flaws and
superior solutions. I also don't think that writing documentation is
boring. Writing good documentation for a product like MSEgui is an exiting
task. The problem is money. As a capitalist I must invest my time where I
get the most profit. ;-)

&gt;<i> In the beginning,

</I>&gt;<i> Well, sorry for the digression, these were just a few thoughts about

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Sure, go ahead with documentation of the pieces you know, it has been
discussed many times. Or send EUR 70'000 in order I can do the first steps
of documentation myself. ;-)

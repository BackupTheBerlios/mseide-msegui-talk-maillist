<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Thu, 21 Oct 2010 09:00:13 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt; (It seems your MSEGUI has grown to a state where it is near to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impossible for a casual user to cope with its complexitiy, and only the

&gt;<i> One can assume that all what must be done can be done with MSEgui in an

</I>
That'd be very helpful only if there were easy and unequivocal definitions
of &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot;. But as things are, this is not very much of a
guideline, unfortunately...

&gt;<i> I don't think that writing documentation is least rewarding and least
</I>&gt;<i> productive. While writing documentation one often finds design flaws and
</I>
That sounds very refreshing - but your code speaks differently, as I see
it. For me, it is important to have some special feature's implentation
detailed either by a comment alone, or by a combination of &quot;telltale&quot; names
and comments. For that, I heartily dislike the so-called &quot;Hungarian
Notation&quot; of Borland legacy. It even can confound the reader completely by
disfiguring it to a degree that makes it completely unreadable. In any way,
it makes it unspeakable.
Beyond that, your view is the one of a &quot;super developper&quot;, who does all of
a project himself, and only has to keep enough information on hand to know
himself what he did, need to do yet and should do for refinement.
Documentation for _users_ has to a lot more primitive - it has to present
the structural detail you know by heart, rather than explain specific
implementation decisions, usually.
_This_ kind of documentation is best _not _ done by the developper himself.

&gt;<i> boring. Writing good documentation for a product like MSEgui is an exiting
</I>&gt;<i> task. The problem is money.
</I>
These two statements do not fit together.
(I understand you meant to say &quot;exciting&quot;, above.)

&gt;<i> task. The problem is money. As a capitalist I must invest my time where I
</I>&gt;<i> get the most profit. ;-)
</I>
So that's just what I started out with: The project has grown to a size
where you had to put in more effort than you can afford to keep it public
as it is now.
You probabely have two choices here:
- One, find a couple guys who volunteer for building a documentation system
(there were discussions about that, and there seem to be such people), have
_them_ do the whole work and do just the reviewing. It might be that even
the latter could be to much already for a single person.
- Or, create a _team_ of people to develop your system. Each member would
be resonsible for a specified part of it, including documentation; and this
way, you would have a vital interest to get good documentation, because
you would &quot;degrade&quot; to a regular user, too. I guess this will not at all
appeal to you, though...

The remaining possibility is that your project will keep on stumbling
along, with a group of loyal users that use it for different reasons, but
each one only to a very small degree. The only one capable of using it fully
will still be just you; sort of, at least, because of all the patches added
on user request.

&gt;<i> Sure, go ahead with documentation of the pieces you know, it has been
</I>&gt;<i> discussed many times.
</I>
That much to say about &quot;rewarding, exciting task&quot;....

&gt;<i> discussed many times. Or send EUR 70'000 in order I can do the first steps
</I>&gt;<i> of documentation myself. ;-)
</I>
Maybe you could get you a federal fund on software development? ;-&gt;

Well, I didn't want to start another end- and fruitless thread on
documentation. There were too many already, and you know the result.

(But still - because you did address me - there's another observation.
I recently sent you a couple scripts to generate some simple lists and
charts, which could be used for documentation purposes. You didn't even
mention whether they did work for you. Could missing coordination be one
ingredient to a failure to produce documentation?)

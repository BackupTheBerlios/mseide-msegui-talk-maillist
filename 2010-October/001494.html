</I>&gt;<i> So why not use Lazarus
</I>As said. Lazarus does a bad job with the Event Queue implementation. 
Firstly I feel that the way it is done (duplicating large code chunks 
for each Widget Type) is not good programming style and results in a 
manageability chaos, and secondly I do agree with the comments I got on 
a similar request some days ago in the German Lazarus Forum by Vincent 
that the Windowish Message is not a decent form event type for this 
issue, but a dedicated event providing for a flexible passing of queued 
parameters to the target event would be by far more sensible and  
&quot;Object Pascal Style&quot;. (Here I feel the MSE Event Queue could be used or 
enhanced for that purpose.)
&gt;<i> or MSEgui?
</I>This of course is a more personal cause. We have a couple of well 
trained Delphi programmer and need to port a set of large Delphi 
applications. It will be hard enough to re-train them on Lazarus and to 
do the ported programs in a way that they can be compiled as well with 
Delphi as with Lazarus. I fear that doing this with MSE will be not viable.
&gt;<i> I think FPC should concentrate on the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler.
</I>FPC already provides the RTL (compilable for lots of OSes and archs). As 
we agree that Event Driven programming is a core of Object Pascal, IMHO 
the Compiler / RTL  should provide this.

The syntax already provide the (Windowish - this not really nice) 
&quot;procedure ... Message&quot; construct for Event handling, but no means in 
the RTL that uses it.

If in future the syntax would be enhanced for a (Prism compatible) 
&quot;parallel loop&quot; / &quot;future variable&quot; construct (which I definitely vote 
for) the RTL would need to provide a thread pool to make this workable. 
Here I feel that en Event Queue might be a very sensible way to do the 
necessary synchronization.

&gt;<i> I forked most of the RTL (TThread for example which is a subject
</I>&gt;<i> on fpc-pascal mailinglist at the moment) because the mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> implementation did not fit the needs of MSEgui exactly. On the other hand
</I>&gt;<i> functionality optimized for MSEgui will not please everybody.
</I>This is very bad news indeed. A common code base for all FPC based 
systems would be very appropriate for an open source project. Is there 
no chance to re-unit the branches ?

I do know that TThread (WaitFor just seems to have been improved, 
Synchronize is known to not working perfectly ) is a weak spot with 
Lazarus. Maybe this is the result of a not perfect implementation in the 
RTL. So maybe Lazarus could benefit from your work on the RTL....

<PRE>Hallo Martin,

...
&gt;<i> &gt; mention whether they did work for you. Could missing coordination be one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ingredient to a failure to produce documentation?)
</I> 
&gt;<i> The main point is that I don't need enduser documentation. I also do not
</I>
I understand that - that was the starting point for my digression, after
all. I know this situation well, as I'm also a one-man-developper-team. You
ought to be weary about this, and constantly look out to find someone to
put the documentation issue on. As the developper, you _cannot_ really
write satisfying end user documentation. And if you're trying to write
documentation while programing, both get into each other's way quickly.
If you're writing documentation, you cannot write code. Yes, you might find
some flaw, but to fix that, you will have to _stop_ writing documentation,
temporarily. And maybe after the fix, you might find that you have to start
over writing this part of the documentation...

&gt;<i> need lists and charts of my software so I didn't think that your
</I>&gt;<i> contribution was sent to me but to the MSEgui community and the possible
</I>&gt;<i> documentation writers. That means I did not test your scripts, sorry.
</I>
That's what I wanted to say with the last parentetical sentence of the
previous posting.

&gt;<i> Ehm, I read your statement that I should stop publishing MSEide+MSEgui
</I>&gt;<i> code if I am not willing to deliver good enduser documentation too,
</I>&gt;<i> correct? ;-)
</I>
I cannot hinder you interpreting my words in any way you want - I already
realized that it is impossible to give words to any statment in such a way
as to be unmisunderstandably.

What I wrote was under the - not at all unprecedented - impression that
carrying on in the current way at least _might_ lead to a micro environment
niche filled by you, your MSEIDE+MSEGUI, some loyal users trying to grasp
as much as they need, and not very much beyond.
(This also applies to many similar projects - they grow for as long as
their promoter skeeps them running, never grow beyond a very small
footprint, and nearly vanish soon after the &quot;driving power&quot; turns away.)

<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Thu, 30 Sep 2010 21:18:41 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt; think I just removed &quot;fonttab&quot; and not &quot;fontactivetab&quot;.)
</I>...
&gt;<i> Ca you reproduce the error? If yes please send the *.mfm and steps how to
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce.
</I>
Yes, at least kind of - maybe you can as well.

I just tried it so: I have a &quot;tabwidget&quot; on the form that has tabs using
the parent font style. Then I took the &quot;tabwidget&quot;, opened the &quot;tab&quot;
subcomponent, and clicked at the &quot;fontactivetab&quot; entry, creating a new font
style. This didn't work, but immediately produced an access violation
message! (No further text, only &quot;Access violation&quot;.) I then didn't close
the IDE, just &quot;clicked away&quot; the message window. The font didn't seem to
have been created, but after switching to another component and back to the
tabwidget's tab subcomponent, an entry &quot;ttab_fontactivetab&quot; was shown in
the value column near &quot;fontactivetab&quot;. Trying to open it didn't produce
anything unusual. Closing the project then produces a save requester, where
I responded with the default &quot;Yes&quot;. Then after reopening the project the
error message I posted before appears, and the form cannot be reloaded
correctly. There seem to be just two lines added to the .mfm file:

    tab_fontactivetab.xscale =  1.0000000000000000E+0000
    tab_fontactivetab.dummy = 0

Now to the _really_ weird part: When I tried to _first_ add a font to the
&quot;fonttab&quot; field, there was no problem, and there was no problem either
adding a font to the &quot;fontactivetab&quot; field thereafter!
There was neither a problem _deleteing_ both &quot;fontactivetab&quot; and &quot;fonttab&quot;,
but deleting the &quot;fonttab&quot; font only, then closing and saving the project
also produces the error on reopening it.

BTW, as I had to reopen the project quite some times now and each time
select a component on the object inspector, it was rather annoying that the
object inspector appears completely blank after loading a project - it
doesn't show a component preloaded, not even the main form. It doesn't even
contain a component list in its top drop down selector, you have to go to
the form, select a component first, and only then are allowed to select
anything in the object inspector.

&gt;<i> &gt; mouse after activation. I have to shift the mouse cursor into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window of interest to heave that on top, although this should normally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not be neccessary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Openbox 3.11.4.2 works well for me with MSEide. Did you activate the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;focus under Mouse&quot; option in Openbox?
</I>
Uh, this is a lot newer than what I got here - mine's only version
3.4.11.2, close to 7 subversions older.
I'll have to look out for a newer version then, I guess...

BTW, yes, I have &quot;focus under Mouse&quot; active, though just now I'm unsure
what this effects.

Thanks for the help and information!

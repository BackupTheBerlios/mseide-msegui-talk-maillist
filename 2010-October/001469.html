<PRE>  Hi Martin,

Here is a copy of a mail from the Lazarus developers List.

I suggested to provide a GUI independent Event Queue (such as MSE has) 
in the FPC RTL. I feel that taking the well tested and (IMHO) 
excellently done MSE code for this would be a good idea.

It would be a great step for Lazarus, if they would be able to use such 
code in the RTL instead of implementing a (different) Event Queue in 
each Widget Type (AFAIK, currently six implementation: Windows, KDE2, 
KDE3,  GNOME,  Mac and FPGUI)

I think MSE would benefit from such a move, too.

Maybe you are interested in helping the FPC team to make this happen. 
(even though I am very unsure if the Lazarus team really will follow).

</I>That is right, but it would need more than a one person team. It of
course would need a new svn branch as well in FPC as in Lazarus. So the
appropriate experts would need to help. I did (most of) an
implementation using code taken from MSE (I consider the quality of this
code extremely high and Martin was very helpful when I worked on his
code. He even refactured his code base to avoid the name &quot;Event&quot; that
was used in a different definition as it is in Lazarus.)

</I>What do you think should be considered superior.



This is what I think would be improved;

  - an Event Queue would be available in non-Lazarus and in
Lazarus-non-GUI applications (so even MSE could benefit from moving part
of it's code into the FPC RTL)

  - additional to the current LCL event mechanism &quot;SendMessage&quot; /
&quot;Procedure ... Message&quot; (which would be implemented on top of the new
one) we would have an RTL based &quot;FireEvent&quot; / &quot;Application.Event&quot;
mechanism that not only fires &quot;Windowish&quot; Events with three 32 Bit
Parameters but Event handlers with multiple marshalized/queued
parameters. A &quot;Procedure...Event&quot; syntax candy could be done on top of that.

  - The implementation could be done in a thread save way so that an
Application object could be instantiated by a worker thread and so same
gets its own event queue allowing for inter-thread notification and
RTL-based TTimers, thus allowing for a decent event-driven programming
paradigm in all threads

  - the &quot;Event-Queue&quot; code is centralized in the RTL and not
reduplicated in any Widget Type, improving manageability and thus
helping enhancing and debugging it (see: currently broken implementation
for Synchronize and SendMessage in Linux, not yet existing
Delphi-compatible  TThread.Queue)

  - this could be the base of thread-pool driven implementation of
Prism-compatible parallel loops / future variables by means of the RTL
and appropriate syntax candy. (Other ways of providing parallel
execution can be considered as well)



What will not be improved:

  - performance (it supposedly will not be degraded, either), unless we
in fact think about parallel loops or other ways of parallelizing)

  - current projects and &quot;Delphi&quot;-code will not benefit (but it of
course will not need any modification)



I don't have much hope that the maintainers of the different Widget Type
implementations agree that this is a viable improvement.

-Michael

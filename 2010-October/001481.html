such ;) )

Lazarus is meant to provide the missing stuff on top of FPC and the FPC 
RTL to make those a viable Delphi replacement, while additionally 
providing Cross-Platform and Cross-Architecture compatibility.

MSE has exactly the same intention, but here, additionally, the 
(obvious, seeming and/or felt) shortcomings are intended to be improved, 
while of course dropping too close Delphi compatibility.

So both Lazarus and MSE provide the missing pieces: IDE and GUI Library

As well Delphi as Lazarus as MSE support doing non-GIU FPC application 
assisted by the graphical IDE, while FPC alone only provides doing 
non-GIU FPC application assisted by a non-graphical very old-stylish and 
restricted IDE.

The intention of this thread is not mainly to improve Lazarus, but to 
improve the PC RTL.

A main benefit of programming with Object Pascal (&quot;Delphi-Language&quot;) is 
programming in an &quot;Event Driven way&quot;. The benefit is that the &quot;normal&quot; 
programmer does not need to bother with the complexity of multi-threaded 
programming (mutual exclusion/access, debugging issues etc.) but most of 
the code runs in a single thread (in automatically queued and scheduled 
&quot;run-to-completion&quot; Events) and thus is much more secure and easily 
understandable. Advanced programmers still are able to do threads for 
improving latency and (multi-core-driven) performance. They can 
encapsulate this in units/objects and provide them to &quot;normal&quot; 
programmers by a Main-Thread-Event Driven API (excellent example: 
AsyncPro for Delphi, now open-sourced in SourceForge).

This is not only true when doing GUI programs (here the GUI events &lt;such 
as messages in Windows, callbacks with other GUI tool kits&gt; ask very 
loudly for event driven programming). Bit it's also true with other 
applications (e.g. embedded gadgets, Server applications, &quot;fast-CGI&quot; 
programs etc. Here Events are fired from timers, hardware connected to 
the controller, serial ports, USB, TCP/IP sockets, worker threads, ...). 
Well-known Open-Core example for a non-GUI event driven tool: AsyncPro 
for Delphi again.

With Delphi all this is easy, as Windows provides the Event mechanism 
out of the box. So it does not matter whether the application uses the 
Windows' GUI or not. The Event (here: &quot;Message&quot;) queue is in place 
anyway. I don't know whether the newest Delphi release, that is said to 
be able to do programs for Linux, is able to do Event Driven programs 
for Linux without GUI binding. I doubt it.

_MSE_ seems to do a good job providing exactly this (Event Driven 
programs for all Systems) using an OS independent Event Queue 
implementation without GUI binding. AFAIK it even is thread safe so that 
a worker thread optionally can be provided with an Event Queue.

_Lazarus_ IMO does a rather bad job here. It provides a lot of different 
&quot;Widget Types&quot; (such as Windows, KDE2, KDE3, Mac, FPGUI, nonGIU, 
FastCGI, ...). While I do like the idea of choosing  a &quot;Widget Type&quot; for 
an Application, it's a really bad idea that each &quot;Widget Type&quot; has its 
own independent implementation of the Event Queue mechanism (even KDE2 
and KDE3 each use their own code base):
  - Windows: not much code in the LCL, as the Windows Message Queue is 
used, no provision for Event Queues for worker threads
  - KDE2, KDE3, MAC, FPGUI: lots of code in the LCL, no provision for 
Event Queues for worker threads
  - nonGUI, FastCGI: not implemented, so event driven programming can't 
be done.

_FPC _itself does not provide any Event Queue implementation by itself, 
so Event Driven programming needs add-ons such as Lazarus or MSE. This 
also is why the RTL can't provide things like TTimer and inter-Thread 
Event, even though it is decently possible to implement these 
functionality in an OS and Arch independent way, similar as all other 
RTL functions. (Fact proven by MSE.)

Of course this is why in the moment it's impossible for the FPC team to 
plan enhancing the language with &quot;modern&quot; performance-enhancing 
&quot;parallel execution&quot; constructs that exploit the now ubiquitous multiple 
core machines such as the Prism compatible &quot;parallel loop&quot; and &quot;future 
variable&quot; paradigm, that could be implemented in the RTL using a thread 
pool.

This is why I strongly vote for implementing an OS independent Event 
Queue mechanism in the RTL, and MSE seems to provide a perfect code base 
for this.

Once done, all PC based system could benefit from this.

Thanks for listening,
-Michael

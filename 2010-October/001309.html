<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Thu, 30 Sep 2010 09:42:41 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt; Seitenwahl.tab_fontactivetab.shadow_color: Access violation&quot;!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't even _look up_ this value!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Access violations should never happen. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Steps to reproduce? An assumption is that something went wrong while
</I>
Ugh - that's tough... This was an unexpected incident (of course), and I
wasn't very attentious as to what I had exactly done before...

&gt;<i> reading the old *.mfm where the tab properties are stored differently.
</I>
I'd rather not think this was the cause, because the conversion should have
been done long before already, since I had tried quite some time to get the
program working as expected by then. The IDE should've read the .mfm only
once, at the beginning of this &quot;session&quot;, shouldn't it?

&gt;<i> &gt; And upon trying to move the error message dialog to the workspace where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm typing this, the message window got lost ....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After an AV you should close MSEide immediately because there is a big
</I>&gt;<i> risk that it has become unstable.
</I>
I just wanted to avoid constant switching between the workspaces - this
didn't do anything harmful. And &quot;just&quot; moving an existing window between
workspaces should be a window-manager-only-issue, shouldn't it?
But maybe not; the old IBM backing store patent issue still seems to be a
hindrance to implement simple and effective window manipulation functions...

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, the focus behaviour of the IDE is somewhat, err, unusual, as to
</I>...
&gt;<i> If the pointer moves from outside in the area of the main menu and MSEide
</I>&gt;<i> has the focus the main menu window will be brought to front in order all
</I>&gt;<i> items are visible. Another Openbox effect maybe?
</I>
But here, and only with the newly compiled trunk IDE, it doesn't succeed
usually. Most often, the component palette wins over all others.
My openbox is version 3.4.11.2.

&gt;<i> It is possible to switch off Z-order handling with the comand line
</I>&gt;<i> parameter --NOZORDERHANDLING.
</I>
Just tried - it behaves now. Seems like you're trying to do too much with
your own code.

&gt;<i> &gt; (s), where the editor also had the old behaviour of &quot;jumping&quot; to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearest word begin whether forward or backward. The new behaviour is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really awkward, always jumping to the _farthest_ end of the nearest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; word. I _heartily_ _dislike_ it so. And it is _not_ configurable!
</I>
&gt;<i> Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right? It has been changed on repeatedly user request and I
</I>
I know, and I opposed against it here before. I _knew_ the behaviour from
my mail editor, and I _did_ mention that I regard this as awkward. Others
didn't opine so firmly, but there were not many voices in favour of the new
behaviour. I seem to remember just one...

&gt;<i> find it logical. If the cursor is in the middle of a word Ctrl+Left jumps
</I>&gt;<i> to left word border, Ctrl+Right to the right.
</I>
If it were just _within_ a word, that was alright with me. But it also
jumps to the _far_ end of the nearest word if it is outside any word, e.g.
at the left margin of a line. Pressing Ctrl-Right there sends the cursor to
the _end_ of the first word in the line, and pressing Ctrl-Left sends it to
the _beginning_ of the last word on the previous line.
If you want to set it to the beginning of the word at the right (from
within a current one), you have to perform what I once saw called the
&quot;monkey motion&quot; of sending it right _twice_, then backing up left another
time, instead of just sending it right to the next word's beginning as with
most editors, or only twice to the right, first to the current word's end,
then to the start of the next word.

&gt;<i> &gt; I consider switching to Lazarus because of this...  ;-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to do so. :-)
</I>
What about you? When asked for an adjustment to the editor's behaviour
once, you responded saying you'd set it up so that it provides the most
productivity for you. Does it now still?

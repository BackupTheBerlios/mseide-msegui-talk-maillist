<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Mon, 30 Aug 2010 07:28:47 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The i18n demo in the distribution has event handlers which are working.
</I>
By now, I tested your suggestion where to check the events on closing, and
found that, with the setup as before, the &quot;componentstate&quot; remained stuck
at &quot;cs_loading&quot;, which disabled event processing on closing, and
presumabely at other event processing places as well.

&gt;<i> You should not change the language module in oncreate because oncreate is
</I>&gt;<i> called form the loading process itself. Please use oneventloopstart
</I>&gt;<i> instead or change the language module before creating the form.
</I>
Ok - how should one know?
(BTW, did &quot;oneventloopstart&quot; exist in version before 2.0 already? I never
noticed it yet...)

I changed the logic accordingly, and was greeted by a nice, rouge SIGSEGV
message in the state line of the main menu window. ;-I

Well, I didn't stop there.
I tried to find out what happened, and saw that the &quot;oneventloopstart&quot;
handler was called recursively, probabely caused by &quot;loadlangunit&quot;
reinitializing event processing.
So I made the method calling it a &quot;one-shot&quot; action, removing its own entry
from the event field, and then it (seemed to) worked correctly, even onkey*
and onclose handlers executing correctly.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; task. Please use inherited forms.
</I>...
&gt;<i> It probably makes exactly what what you make with your scripts, it stores
</I>&gt;<i> the differences from ancestor in a *.mfm. But maybe you know it
</I>&gt;<i> better. ;-)
</I>
No, I don't know better with that - not a bit, as I don't know what exactly
they can or cannot do.
It's just that &quot;inherited form&quot; seems to imply by the very usage of the
term that a predefined form is used to serve different purposes, i.e.
adding a few elements to it, changing handlers and so on.
Modifying the _layout_ doesn't seem to fit here - for me, anyway. If you
say it does, I will check it out, but I have to find some information as to
what this is, how it can be used and where it might fit into this
application. So to speak, I need to find the entrance door first...
(BTW, does your above mention of .mfm files mean that these will be loaded
dynamically, or are all variants compiled in any way as well? Just asking.)

&gt;<i> &gt; An event property has to pointer values (see tmethod), I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gdb checks both, probably not.
</I>
Judging from your watches window, given it just the object field, it only
returns the code address. Giving it a &quot;tmethod&quot; typed variable, it shows
both fields; but that's probabely just caused by the type carrying those
two fields as separate pointers explicitely.
It might not usually matter, anyway, as normally either both of them should
have a value &lt;&gt; NIL or both should be NIL at the same time. And there
shouldn't even be a problem if only the code pointer is NIL, the only case
where something might go wrong will probabely be a case where the code
pointer is set and the data pointer is NIL, as any access of object data
will then cause an exception.

Now, I will have to clean up the mess that's piled up and make the current
state fit for deploying - then I'll have to find some time to check out
your recommendation to use &quot;inherited forms&quot;.

Thanks a lot for your help!

(Even though this was another case of &quot;unintended use effects&quot;...
Perhaps it might be useful to prevent execution of &quot;loadlangunit&quot; within a
create handler, or at least put a big remark to that effect in the example
application?)

<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Mon, 16 Aug 2010 07:51:01 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to find the error location lead me to nowhere - some deeply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entrenched routine which didn't have anything to do with loading or
</I>
I got some news about this now. First of all, I upgraded FPC to version 2.4
and your MSEIDE-MSEGUI to version 2.2 (not neccessarily all the latest
ones available;). After recompiling all components affecting the project,
the generated programs _did_ work completely, even after loading the layout
modification library modules!
(But, man, this latest FPC compiler has become picky! It even prescribes
in what order field variables and methods have to appear! The parser seems
to have been downgraded quite a lot.)

And I did even find the cause for the &quot;invalid integer&quot; message box -
there was indeed a wrong value in one line among the host of numbers...
But this demonstrated quite painfully how waek the debugging abilities are
- the pertinent routines all deal with variants, collected in arrays, being
fields of objects, and there is no way to even get at the indices, lest the
variant data themselves. It might be possible for someone with an intimate
knowlegde of the variant data layout and the data structures involved to
get at them to find out what is stored there - without this you're
virtually (;-) blind.
I found the culprit only by reanalyzing the data - searching for a regular
expression covering the correctly formed lines, and having output all the
rest, which included the erroneous line as well. Oh well.

&gt;<i> There is an example in apps/i18ndemo.
</I>
I know - that's where I started from, and that's what I used as a template.
Still, it took me some time to realize that the .trd files are generated
when the project is saved the first time - the program complains about them
missing if one attempts to load a previously created project which was not
yet saved...
And there is no &quot;close&quot; button / function / key - you _rely_ on the window
manager providing a close control. This was a pain with the previous window
manager I used (wmx), as this did _not_ provide one, you had to hold a
mouse button for some time to activate such a function. The fact that ever
more programs (most notably and most annoyingly OpenOffice) relied on such
a window control (generating the need for a window control bar (aka &quot;title
bar&quot;), which I don't really want _at_ _all_) forced me to change; thus I now
use the minimal window manager providing such, openbox.
And, BTW, there's no hint how to close the &quot;make&quot; output window after
processing is done, either. Only by experimenting I found that you can
close it with the escape key. This was a bit annoying, too.
Another annoyance encountered concerns the naming of the generated library
files - it is somewhat of a problem that your loader automatically adds the
&quot;lib&quot; prefix to the name passed in - if this name should contain a path
part, can you imagine what happens? And I think you usually _want_ to
specify a path with the name. If you insist in using the same code for
Windows and Linux, I'm afraid there might be some additional logic for path
manipulation required; instead of the current &quot;aname:= 'lib'+aname+'.so';&quot;
you might write
  aname:= ExtractFilePath (aname)+ 'lib'+ ExtractFileName (aname)+ '.so';

BTW, an idea to enhance the usability of the editor's search function:
If the cursor is within a word, or just if it is within a marked word, it
might be considered convenient if this word is inserted into the search
text entry field automatically. There are even some editors doing this...

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Suggestion: use automatically adjusting layouts. Some possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; elements:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This probabely won't work out - there are some elements that must keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their size to accomodate for bitmap pictures being displayed,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> twidget.bounds_c*min,bounds_c*max.
</I>
I know, this can do it for these. What about having a variable area at the
left, which must be sized according to text to be displayed in two equally
sized columns there, a couple of fixed sized elements, and another variable
region, even containing a couple of different controls (buttons), which are
sized according to, but not neccessarily defined by, the font size of some
characters shown within? Would this work out automatically?

&gt;<i> For variable layouts I often use a combination of widget features and
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>
Yes, this would very well be neccessary, I think. Can be done, of course -
but as the two separate layouts do exist already, at least for now I prefer
the i18n method - it looks rather viable now.

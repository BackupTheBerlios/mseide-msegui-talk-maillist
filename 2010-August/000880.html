</I>The i18n demo in the distribution has event handlers which are working.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I don't think that the tskincontroller component is well suited for the
task. Please use inherited forms.

&gt;<i> BTW, just to avoid false assumptions as to how I used the mechanism, I
</I>&gt;<i> think I should mention that I stripped down the *.trd files to _only_

</I>&gt;<i> _different_ between the versions. I did not retain anything common, as it
</I>&gt;<i> was difficult enough to set up a script that would derive the final .trd
</I>&gt;<i> file from the two form template files; it still requires the intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> generation of a basic .trd file for every form version, renamed
</I>&gt;<i> correspondingly for input to the script. Your use of multiple levels of
</I>&gt;<i> comma separated field names made it somewhat less that trivial...
</I>&gt;<i> (I used awk as a text processor - but this cannot really cope with such a
</I>&gt;<i> setup.)
</I>
Then you must debug why the event handlers are deleted by loading the
difference *.mfm data.

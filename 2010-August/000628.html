The problem is obviously how I described the behaviour. Because what
you described is exactly what I want. :-) The current MSEide editor
works different. This is why I felt confident in saying &quot;all editors&quot;.
Even the editbox in Mozilla Firefox (which I'm using to write this
email in Gmail) behaves like I want - thus your description is better
than mine.

I tried the editors in Lazarus IDE, gEdit, Mozilla Firefox (editbox
widget), Windows notepad, Delphi IDE, Kate, syn edit etc... All of
them have the same behaviour when jumping words. I'm used to this -
due to my years of programming.

So Martin, if you are confused regarding my description. Simply try
any of the above mentioned editors and use Ctrl+[Left|Right]Arrow to
see the behaviour I am talking about.


&gt;<i> There are so many ways an editor can be working that it's almost impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to implement all of them as options, I think.
</I>
I understand that, and also why I offered to do this myself if Martin
is too busy or think other things are more important for him. I'm not
afraid of coding an even thought that if I implement it myself, I'll
make the setting change via the IDE settings files instead of the GUI
because the Editor Options dialog is already quite &quot;busy&quot;. I know
there can be millions of options like this, and why I accept some of
them without fuss - eg: the Shift+DoubleClick being fine with me.

&gt;<i> editor idiosyncrasies as much as possible, mostly by doing without some
</I>&gt;<i> well meant but annoyingly (for me) implemented features.
</I>
IDE's are meant to make you as a programmer more productive. So if it
doesn't and it can't be changed, then that IDE is not meant for you.
This is why I am looking more and more at MSEide. It's easier and
quicker to build than Lazarus IDE, it feels much faster and it seems
more stable. I have been using Lazarus IDE for 5 years, but I feel
they are just implementing more and more &quot;eye candy&quot; and actually
making the IDE more unstable, and thus I am hunting for a replacement
IDE. I want to spend my time programming, not working around IDE bugs.

<PRE>Hallo Martin,

here's another update on my &quot;progress&quot; to get the i18n form layout
modification working.
Actually, it's no longer on the i18n mechanism you provide - after changing
to MSE-IDE 2.2 (and fpc 2.4.0 in the process), this seems to work
&quot;perfectly&quot;.

My latest problem, concerning the background activity of an application
ceasing with time if not constantly &quot;retriggered&quot; by a separately running
timer signalling the program seems to be solved now as well - it seems to
have been something with getting at or passing on the handler address.
It could've been an issue with calling conventions or type specification of
the intermediately used procedural variable, or maybe assimple as accessing
the wrong field for storing this address - Linux provides two kinds of
handler interface, and they used to be passed or retrieved by a union. But
maybe this has changed recently, and I just copied the wrong field...
Anyway, after revising the code and setting up another function to just
retrieve a handler address, this part also seems to work fine.

But now, another problem has surfaced, also unrelated to the i18n functions.
It did appear lately during installation of a customer's new appliance, and
I could not yet find an amendment, Though for now, it's not yet very much
of a problem, I need to find a correction to it before the installation
will be handed to my customer's customer.

The problem is with externally compiled subforms / subwindows, like (self
written) dialogs. (E.g. the screen keypad / keyboard utilities I posted
some time ago.) I cannot tell about your GUI dialogs, because I do not use
them here, but a quick cross check seems to show they're not affected.
The problem shows up by just simply not displaying the pertaining windows,
instead claiming &quot;Resource not found:t {dialog name} fo. {application name}
fo. {dialog name} fo.&quot; (the parts within &quot;{}&quot; are showing the respective
resources' names). For the most part (there are no exceptions as far as I
remember) they're dynamically instantiated, and it doesn't matter whether
there is a unit internal form variable defined or not.

This exact same setup _did_ work correctly with MSEIDE/MSEGUI 1.8, up to
GUI version 1.8b and IDE even 1.8r, and fpc 2.2.5. I didn't work much with
2.0, but I do remember having a problem at a customer with one probabely 2.0
compiled program from this suite, and found it existing with that same setup
(MSEIDE/MSEGUI 2.0 and fpc 2.2.5) on my notebook recently.

The problem also cannot be resolved by clearing all of the .o and .ppu
files, be it only within the project or even for all of MSEGUI's library,
which I _did_ already try (short of reinstallation of the whole stuff).
I cannot even crosscheck with older versions, since there seems to be an
incompatibility between fpc 2.4 and the 2.2 series concerning the wide
string handling (&quot;TWideStringManager&quot; cannot be found with older versions
of MSEGUI). The problem must have been existing with MSEIDE/MSEGUI 2.0 and
fpc 2.2.5 also, though, because that's what I've installed on my notebook,
where I had compiled the latest versions of the programs running at my
customer's installement now.
Do you know about the cause of the problem, and what to do against it?

Sorry for the lengthy description - I thought it might help if I provide
as much dtail as I can figure. If you need me to perform some tests, please
say so here; I've all the neccessary files on my machine here

<PRE>&gt;<i>I find PostgreSQL quite hard to tweak to get good performance. A fresh
</I>&gt;<i>install is *very* slow, and database server optimization is rather
</I>&gt;<i>hard. 
</I>
Me'm disagree. 8.x versions are clever by default &amp; their optimizer is
very well, server parameter optimization is mainly needed for
migrating from 7.x versions for huge databases. 
For example, 8.x optimizer automatcally apply hash &amp; merge jonn w/o
any special indexing.

&gt;<i> Compare that to a fresh install of Firebird 2.x which is fast
</I>&gt;<i>without any tweaks.  I ran the same test suite (from tiOPF project),
</I>&gt;<i>using SqlDB database components (included with FPC). PostgreSQL was
</I>&gt;<i>very slow compared to Firebird - doing the exact same tests. I really
</I>&gt;<i>like the features of PostgreSQL, and the admin tools are very good, I
</I>&gt;<i>just don't know how to get good performance out of it. :-(  Any tips
</I>&gt;<i>or good websites I can look at?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
With a pleasue :) Assume that the main goal of optimization is to
exclude any &quot;bottle necks&quot;. The main of them is disk i/o which is
thousands times as slower than CPU &amp; memory. 
To minimize disk i/o, we can:

1) use minimal set of nececssary indexes - they allow to locate then
to load much smaller parts  of huge DB files, but be aware not to
index data spread evenly through index files (these file may grow very
rapidly ) - low enthropy data like operator codes, office codes,
payment types - since such inedexes may envolve full loading index
files ( the worst case is to retrieve index value from very begginning
&amp; very ending of the index file) thus MAXIMIZING disk i/o - so name
harmful indexes. 
The best candidates for indexing are high enthropies - operation days,
table IDs, sequential numerators, references to ID of master
tables,...
 BTW, low enthropies etc can also be indexed but in a complex index
togehther &amp; after high enthropies - here the higher entropy squeeses
the loadable part of data&amp;index file and the low enthropy will be
applied to this smaller part.

BTW,harmful index may be bypased by spoiling &quot;where/join&quot; SQL-clause
by adding zero of multiplying by 1.0

2) not to use triggers w/o need ( for referential integrity of all DB
entities etc ) - exessive triggers kick database files on any smallest
change to DB thus MAXIMIZING disk i/o once again.   

3) to index complex functional culcalations (regardless of their
entropy if a single calculation is slow because of many work) - it may
take many minites of initial indexing but milliseconds on calls after
indexing 

&gt;<i>To get back to your statement. Have you run any profile on you queries
</I>&gt;<i>to see where it is slow?  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT... 

Do you use sufficient indexes on your
&gt;<i>tables?  Do you pull only the required data, or everything and then
</I>&gt;<i>sort through the mess in the client-side?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I found that many queries can be improved by simply optimizing how you
</I>&gt;<i>write a query, and adding sufficient Indexes to those tables. When I
</I>&gt;<i>started working at our company, one of our reports took 5-8 minutes to
</I>&gt;<i>complete. 
</I>
&gt;<i>It took me 15 minutes to rewrite the query, and now that
</I>&gt;<i>same report is generated in 20 seconds. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Me also got similar (40 times) success just from removing harmful
indedex - PG 8.1 planner just applied merged join instead of those
indexes.

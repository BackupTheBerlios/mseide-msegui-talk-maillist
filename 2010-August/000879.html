<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Sorry, me again...

But first, a response to your message from Tue, 24 Aug 2010 16:05:41 +0200:

&gt;<i> There is a property &quot;text&quot; in &quot;Eingabe&quot; which hides the parameter &quot;text&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> please use &quot;atext&quot; or the like as parameter name.
</I>
Or qualify everything fully; this will do as well.
Oh well, that's the downside of object oriented programming (well, one of
many facets of it, at least) - after several levels of inheritance, it
becomes quite opaque what an object comprises. Which makes it very easy to
duplicate or even override something that's used elsewhere, making you
wonder why your new feature just doesn't do what it should, or worse,
making something &quot;that always worked&quot; suddenly to misbehave.

But I have a new gripe also, which leads me to a question:

Is it possible that with loading a &quot;language unit&quot; containing references to
graphical objects, as I'm still in the attempt to implement for my
application, _cancels_ _every_ (or at least most) of the normal event
processing? (Strangely, the debugger _still_ shows all of them to be set as
expected!)

I got the effect that _none_ of the form events were processed when I used
such a program - I did quite some digging around what might be wrong with
my event methods, until I decided to counter check with that very same
program, just disabling the &quot;loadlangunit&quot; call.
Well, what do you think? _Everything_ I had problems with suddenly worked
correctly!
It even honoured the form options again (I used &quot;fo_screencentered&quot;, but had
to do the positioning explicitly with the &quot;loadlangunit&quot; call)!

Is that a known restriction, an unknown problem, an easyly resolvable
issue, something requiring digging deeply into the innards, or what?
If it could be resolved by some simple means, I would like to be able to
still use this method; if it gets complicated (for me or for you), I'd
rather try some alternative. (Skins, perhaps - but I've yet to figure out
how they're supposed to be used, I've not done anything with them as yet.)

BTW, just to avoid false assumptions as to how I used the mechanism, I
think I should mention that I stripped down the *.trd files to _only_
contain the relaocations and size modifications, i.e. the things that are
_different_ between the versions. I did not retain anything common, as it
was difficult enough to set up a script that would derive the final .trd
file from the two form template files; it still requires the intermediate
generation of a basic .trd file for every form version, renamed
correspondingly for input to the script. Your use of multiple levels of
comma separated field names made it somewhat less that trivial...
(I used awk as a text processor - but this cannot really cope with such a
setup.)
(Perhaps meanwhile I'll just try to simply keep everything else in the
original .trd file, just &quot;flag&quot; it as unchanged. Might be neccessary, if
the modified objects are &quot;stripped down&quot; on loading the alternative
settings. I'll see...)

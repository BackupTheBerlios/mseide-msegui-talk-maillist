<PRE>Hello Martin,

I'd like to ask something very different from the most common theme here.
It has nothing to do with data base handling, and I asked it before already
- but your suggestions from back then don't seem to work (any more).

It's about having an application change its window layout, mainly the size,
according to screen resolution. The application has to take up all screen
space, hiding everything else, as this is the control application for an
industrial appliance where no other concurrent activities are allowed for
the user. The whole system runs under Linux.

When I first asked, I had set up two sets of layouts which I switched
around using a self made script, producing separate sets of programs for
each of the layouts. This became ever more unwieldy in the meantime, so I'm
now searching for a simpler means to change the layout.

Back then, you suggested using the &quot;i18n&quot; ancilliary tool you provide. But
because of lack of time, I never yet came about to try this until recently.
And when I finally tried it, it failed on me - it did switch the layout
correctly (after I had found out how to create the neccessary control
files), but then the application was not functional, it couldn't even be
terminated regularly any more, but had to be killed forcedly.

I understand that the i18n mechanism is really meant for translating
labelling strings and other text, which I don't need (yet), but you said it
could be used for other modifications, too. Is that not supported any more?
What should one use instead? Could this be solved using &quot;skins&quot;? (Do skins
support changing sizes of control elements including the whole window?)
Or is there a mechanism similar to the IDE's way of building an
application's window reading the .mfm file which is also available at the
user level? (This would probabely be the most elegant solution.)

I don't mean to inconvenience you - if there's no easy solution, please
just tell me and ignore my inquiry; I'll try to find some way myself then.
Thank you in advance.

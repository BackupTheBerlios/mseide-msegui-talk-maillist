<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Sun, 15 Aug 2010 17:44:31 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt; the layout correctly (after I had found out how to create the neccessary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control files), but then the application was not functional, it couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even be terminated regularly any more, but had to be killed forcedly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Then probably not all went well. ;-)
</I>
I guess so... With one form, I kept getting an error message that an
integer value was required - even before any processing had started at all.
Trying to find the error location lead me to nowhere - some deeply
entrenched routine which didn't have anything to do with loading or
processing user data at all, and which wasn't really debuggable. I will have
to redo the actions, as a few weeks have passed since, and a few other
projects went in between.

&gt;<i> MSEi18n can be used in order to build different *.mfm files with different
</I>&gt;<i> property values based on common master versions. The *.mfm files are
</I>&gt;<i> compiled into resource so's or dll's which can be switched at runtime.
</I>
Right, that's what I tried to take to use. In fact, the switching _did_
work, but the program was not controllable afterwards, none of the control
elements worked, not even the window manager controls!

&gt;<i> MSEi18n supports string and numeric values. A form designer in order to
</I>&gt;<i> change widget position and size is planned but difficult to implement.
</I>
I would be quite contend with a means to set form size and layout once at
application start. In fact, it's not desirable at all to effect such a
switch when the programm runs. This might not apply, on the other hand,
should it occur that the control labelling has to be switched - this could
very well be required to occur dynamically during a program run.

BTW, I tried to load the generated .so files either in the create event,
the activate event or the show event on program start. All gave identical
results.

&gt;<i> tskincontroller has hooks where user code can control all aspects of
</I>&gt;<i> loaded components (onbeforeupdate, onafterupdate). I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> tskincontroller should be used for layout purposes.
</I>
I've not yet inspected it close enough to know whether it might be able to
cope with this task - does it even allow access to position and size of an
element? Common skin changer implementations seem not to provide for that
usually (but there are a couple of - mainly &quot;multi media&quot; - applications
that do such things [mplayer, I think, is an example]).

&gt;<i> MSEi18n does this, components can be loaded from streams
</I>&gt;<i> (TStream.ReadComponent(), TReader.ReadRootComponent()).
</I>
Yes, I found these functions - that looks like it might be a way to
implement something akin. There might even be other possibilities.

&gt;<i> Suggestion: use automatically adjusting layouts. Some possible elements:
</I>
This probabely won't work out - there are some elements that must keep
their size to accomodate for bitmap pictures being displayed, some have to
change according to textual content, and there's a chart display that
should provide a nice display scaled according to screen resolution...
And it still wouldn't cope with the required font size changes, which had
to be done &quot;manually&quot; just as resizing the window.
Of course, all of this can be done...
At least, it would be quite some work and require quite some modifications
to an already running and several times deployed application. Should
perhaps be the last option cvonsidered, if nothing else works... ;-&gt;

I will pursue this further, though it will probabely take a while, since
this is just one of a number of projects I'm working on. But it's an
ongoing development, and it should be manageable by the people at my
customer, who aren't programmers at all, yet still have to be able to
tailor some functions to their customer's desire [requirements]. ;-)

Thank you very much for your suggestions.
If I find a viable solution, I will probabely report. ;-)

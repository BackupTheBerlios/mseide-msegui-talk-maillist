&gt;<i> Hallo Julio,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Du schriebst am Sat, 5 Mar 2011 21:23:05 +0100:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why do you use graphics at all.. you can do it in text mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, anything just textual can be done in text mode. Charts are one of the
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Really? I did charts using text mode when no graphics available. But it was
years ago...Even you could do images with a simple typewriter ;)  and
extending it to video...do you know libcaca? (this name sounds funny in
spanish)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can't find an icon for every thing.. but common icons are easy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identify; you also have the tool tips.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, yes - they're easy to identify. Are they easy to _recognize_, too?
</I>&gt;<i> Or do you _need_ the tooltips to recognize them, i.e. know what they mean?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Probably that's the reason why, a lot of times, a learning is required
before program usage. There are books..manuals.... Lots of times a look at
the screen is not enought to discover how it works.


&gt;<i> &gt; asked him about it. You have the freedom to use the standard icon or even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an empty icon if you don't like  it ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, maybe not - there _are_ applications that do _not_ give you a
</I>&gt;<i> choice; after all, it is not a simple taks to provide for a choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You also have time available I see ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm interested in a discussion or too deeply entrenched to avoid a
</I>&gt;<i> response, what choice do I have?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Here you have two options, argue or be quiet. I'm glad to talk with you.
Even when I guess we think very close.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well... creating some tiny pixel heaps with unrecognizable shape to
</I>&gt;<i> mark
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not talking about icons.. I'm talking about the final look of the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You did before, and you didn't state that this wasn't what you were focused
</I>&gt;<i> upon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>My first message:

&quot;Once my programs are working fine, is time to set it beautiful. Skins,
faces... are great. I'm happy using it. Icons are another thing... default
icons using in MSEide+MSegui look a bit outdated to these ages (I say it in
a friendly way) :)...&quot;

Was simply a thought I wanted to share.



&gt;<i> &gt; application. Icons are a small part of the application and of course you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't do everything with a icon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree here fully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And to put a critique above it - replacing the now customary &quot;kinked
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's your point of view and I respect it. I'm not sure if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand it or simply you like to argue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what you think I wouldn't understand. This isn't just to
</I>&gt;<i> argue, this is my opinion about the icons you praised so highly:
</I>&gt;<i> they are much less recognizable than the ones used currently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not by far. Those &quot;silken&quot; icons you keep in such high esteem are much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; less recognizable, not at all widely known, and require another round
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Of course, you can view this as creating a new script system, just by
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; huh?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I didn't understood what you meant, sorry.


&gt;<i> What about? The critique towards your icons, or my parenthetical remark?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right. I don't use icons a lot.  In fact I use more text than icons ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Didn't show regarding your advertising a different icon style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No sense.  I was looking for themeable applications. Icons are part of the
themes (and not only small icons.. like in common dialogs showing a question
mark icon, stop icon....it can help you to identify the sense of the message
just before reading it. Of course you can think different. Using
MSEide+MSEgui you have the freedom to use it or not)



&gt;<i> &gt; but... talking about icons and file dialog.. I'm sure normal users can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identify correctly every function in the dialog just with a icon, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; almost every file dialog out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is a case where the set of idiograms has become fairly stable
</I>&gt;<i> already. But it is a very limited set used in very limited setting, and
</I>&gt;<i> even you can find large variations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree.


&gt;<i> &gt; i.e. the little house... pointing you to your home directory. and take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less space than the text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not really, not in english, at least. Besides, I hate this very sign - it
</I>&gt;<i> is used consistently for very different things by different applications
</I>&gt;<i> and usually set really unpredictably. (One example is the file dialog of
</I>&gt;<i> Open Office - it also uses a &quot;home&quot; icon, but how can one know _what_ just
</I>&gt;<i> this time the &quot;home&quot; directory is set to? It changes with every invocation.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid, that's the same with the new &quot;home&quot; icon on the MSEGUI file
</I>&gt;<i> dialog...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you suggest, e.g., for a control to program the configuration of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; microcontroller?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's easy... but I'll let you to discover it ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no clue. I cannot imagine anything unequivocally recognizable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sorry.. I was being ironic ;)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; increase the temperature setting of some heater? (The latter one should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be easy for you;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have I said there is an icon for every need at some place? :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, you cannot devise one for _this_? :-O
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, of course. Probably there are a lot.
</I>
One thing I like of MSEide+MSEgui is the ability to customize almost evey
thing so you can use things or not. You have the freedom. Of couse I also
can share my thoughts with Martin and all the users about these things.

Thank you for sharing your thoughs with us.


Cheers.


Julio

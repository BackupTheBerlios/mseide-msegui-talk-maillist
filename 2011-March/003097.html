<PRE>Why do you use graphics at all.. you can do it in text mode.

You can't find an icon for every thing.. but common icons are easy to
identify; you also have the tool tips.


I'm sure Martin have his reasons to use those low color icons, I only asked
him about it. You have the freedom to use the standard icon or even an empty
icon if you don't like  it ;)

&gt;<i> Hallo Julio,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Du schriebst am Sat, 5 Mar 2011 10:16:31 +0100:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I said in previous message, I'm working in look and feel program. The
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e., that is your job? Well, then you'd have the time available, of
</I>&gt;<i> course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You also have time available I see ;)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; visual part of a program is also very important, from my point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's art ;)  (extending the concept of 'The art of computer programming')
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well... creating some tiny pixel heaps with unrecognizable shape to mark
</I>&gt;<i> some control areas of unrelated function, as it often is, is certainly art
</I>&gt;<i> at its best...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not talking about icons.. I'm talking about the final look of the
application. Icons are a small part of the application and of course you
can't do everything with a icon.


&gt;<i> And to put a critique above it - replacing the now customary &quot;kinked sheet&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> picture by a blurry all-blueish not-quite-rectangle that could mean
</I>&gt;<i> anything at all isn't really what I consider an enhancement of useability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's your point of view and I respect it. I'm not sure if you don't
understand it or simply you like to argue.


&gt;<i> Not by far. Those &quot;silken&quot; icons you keep in such high esteem are much less
</I>&gt;<i> recognizable, not at all widely known, and require another round of getting
</I>&gt;<i> used to in addition of learning what the heck any of them might be meant to
</I>&gt;<i> stand for. Icons commonly aren't of any use if you don't know what
</I>&gt;<i> application they're used in and what they mean _in_ _this_ _specific_
</I>&gt;<i> _setting_. It can and _does_ differ, and there can be and are different
</I>&gt;<i> ones used for the same function
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Of course, you can view this as creating a new script system, just by
</I>&gt;<i> tinkering around with any number of signs and trying to attach meaning to
</I>&gt;<i> them, inconsistently and varyingly. It may be that, within a couple hundred
</I>&gt;<i> years, something mainly consistent and acknowledged might emerge, it may
</I>&gt;<i> also be that after some time of tinkering, the .tinkerers and the users
</I>&gt;<i> alike will get tired and this picturesque mark up system vanishes. We'll
</I>&gt;<i> have to see, I guess... ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
huh?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, don't you care about the  look and feel of the programs? I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important, form the users point of view.. of course the programs must do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their work fine, this is most important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An application user interface has to clearly state what its controls will
</I>&gt;<i> do, I think. That's why I don't use icons a lot, it's challenging enough to
</I>&gt;<i> come up with those short snippets of text that fit in the available space
</I>&gt;<i> for any control.
</I>

Right. I don't use icons a lot.  In fact I use more text than icons ;)
but... talking about icons and file dialog.. I'm sure normal users can
identify correctly every function in the dialog just with a icon, like
almost every file dialog out there.
i.e. the little house... pointing you to your home directory. and take less
space than the text.


&gt;<i> Restricting this space further by placing mysterious
</I>&gt;<i> micropictures there is mostly a waste of space. Noone can figure out what a
</I>&gt;<i> randomly selected icon might mean if it's for some special function of an
</I>&gt;<i> appliance. What immediately recognizable picture would you suggest, e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> for a control to program the configuration of a microcontroller?
</I>
That's easy... but I'll let you to discover it ;)

&gt;<i> Or to
</I>&gt;<i> increase the temperature setting of some heater? (The latter one should be
</I>&gt;<i> easy for you;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Have I said there is an icon for every need at some place? :)


Cheers.


Julio

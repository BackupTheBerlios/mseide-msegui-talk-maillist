I haven't looked at in in a while, but I do remember that was pretty 
nice indeed.

That is purely an implementation issue of the cross-platform demos - not 
related to the AggPas library itself.


  within 1/4 of screen area. So, at a glance, it looks like

</I>
Pixel's gui toolkit (I believe called eLiquid) is full of bugs and other 
issues. It's not near the quality or usability of MSEgui or fpGUI. So 
again, it's not a general FPC custom draw issue, but simply a 
implementation issue of Pixel.

Pixel32 is very overhyped though. Yes it might look good to the eye, but 
when you start using it, it falls short rather quickly. My wife is a 
professional photographer, and I gave here a demo of Pixel32 to try out. 
Most of here photos were too large for Pixel32 to handle, or were simply 
unbearably slow in editing. So I think Pixel32 needs a lot more work 
before it can compete at the same level as Gimp or Photoshop. Not to 
mention the fact that Pixel32 hasn't had any updates in years - it is 
pretty much an abandoned product. :-(

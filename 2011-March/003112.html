<PRE>Hallo Julio,

Yes, that's possible, kind of. What kind of measurement data did you chart
then, and were they used for process verification for your customer too?

Yes, people with to much leisure time did that. Some still do, even in news
group postings.

&gt;<i> extending it to video...do you know libcaca? (this name sounds funny in

</I>
It's one of the dependencies of mplayer on Arch Linux. It's a pure waste of
space, and time of the developers. There's even a monochrome version of it,
called &quot;aalib&quot; (of which it is a successor).

&gt;<i> &gt; Or do you _need_ the tooltips to recognize them, i.e. know what they

</I>
Yes, right, there are the manuals. Or, rather, nowadays, there _should be_
manuals. Sometimes you get some pdf providing a click-list step-by-step
introduction. It you're lucky, it even describes vaguely what this effects.
Manuals? There are no manuals any more, none that can claim to be such
seriously, anyway. Even program help has been stripped down to just reread
the inscription of the controls - requesting help for an &quot;open&quot; button will
usually state that, by &quot;pressing&quot; this button, you open a file. Would you
have thought of that? But _what_ that file would be for, or what kind it
had to be, noone knows. Or tells you, the user, anyway. Dreary state of the
art.

&gt;<i> No sense.  I was looking for themeable applications. Icons are part of the

You advertised some icon set to be used instead of the set that comes with
MSEGUI. That's what I responded to.

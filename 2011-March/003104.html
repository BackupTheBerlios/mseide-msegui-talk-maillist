<PRE>Hallo Julio,

Du schriebst am Sat, 5 Mar 2011 21:23:05 +0100:

&gt;<i> Why do you use graphics at all.. you can do it in text mode.
</I>
Yes, anything just textual can be done in text mode. Charts are one of the
exceptions.

&gt;<i> You can't find an icon for every thing.. but common icons are easy to
</I>&gt;<i> identify; you also have the tool tips.
</I>
Ah, yes - they're easy to identify. Are they easy to _recognize_, too?
Or do you _need_ the tooltips to recognize them, i.e. know what they mean?

&gt;<i> asked him about it. You have the freedom to use the standard icon or even
</I>&gt;<i> an empty icon if you don't like  it ;)
</I>
Maybe, maybe not - there _are_ applications that do _not_ give you a
choice; after all, it is not a simple taks to provide for a choice.

&gt;<i> You also have time available I see ;)
</I>
If I'm interested in a discussion or too deeply entrenched to avoid a
response, what choice do I have?

&gt;<i> &gt; Well... creating some tiny pixel heaps with unrecognizable shape to mark
</I>...
&gt;<i> I'm not talking about icons.. I'm talking about the final look of the
</I>
You did before, and you didn't state that this wasn't what you were focused
upon.

&gt;<i> application. Icons are a small part of the application and of course you
</I>&gt;<i> can't do everything with a icon.
</I>
I agree here fully.

&gt;<i> &gt; And to put a critique above it - replacing the now customary &quot;kinked
</I>...
&gt;<i> It's your point of view and I respect it. I'm not sure if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand it or simply you like to argue.
</I>
I don't understand what you think I wouldn't understand. This isn't just to
argue, this is my opinion about the icons you praised so highly:
they are much less recognizable than the ones used currently.

&gt;<i> &gt; Not by far. Those &quot;silken&quot; icons you keep in such high esteem are much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less recognizable, not at all widely known, and require another round
</I>...
&gt;<i> &gt; (Of course, you can view this as creating a new script system, just by
</I>...
&gt;<i> huh?
</I>
What about? The critique towards your icons, or my parenthetical remark?

&gt;<i> Right. I don't use icons a lot.  In fact I use more text than icons ;)
</I>
Didn't show regarding your advertising a different icon style.

&gt;<i> but... talking about icons and file dialog.. I'm sure normal users can
</I>&gt;<i> identify correctly every function in the dialog just with a icon, like
</I>&gt;<i> almost every file dialog out there.
</I>
Yes, this is a case where the set of idiograms has become fairly stable
already. But it is a very limited set used in very limited setting, and
even you can find large variations.

&gt;<i> i.e. the little house... pointing you to your home directory. and take
</I>&gt;<i> less space than the text.
</I>
Not really, not in english, at least. Besides, I hate this very sign - it
is used consistently for very different things by different applications
and usually set really unpredictably. (One example is the file dialog of
Open Office - it also uses a &quot;home&quot; icon, but how can one know _what_ just
this time the &quot;home&quot; directory is set to? It changes with every invocation.
I'm afraid, that's the same with the new &quot;home&quot; icon on the MSEGUI file
dialog...)

&gt;<i> &gt; you suggest, e.g., for a control to program the configuration of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; microcontroller?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's easy... but I'll let you to discover it ;)
</I>
I have no clue. I cannot imagine anything unequivocally recognizable.

&gt;<i> &gt; increase the temperature setting of some heater? (The latter one should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be easy for you;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have I said there is an icon for every need at some place? :)
</I>
Oh, you cannot devise one for _this_? :-O

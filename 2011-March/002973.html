</I>&gt;<i> I meant that function has been implement years ago. It hasn't. Please try 
</I>&gt;<i> again with trunk 4367.
</I>
OK thanks, that works. Could the same be applied to &quot;Project -&gt; Open&quot; as
well please.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you use cinerama? The window should be centered in the current screen and 
</I>&gt;<i> not divided between monitors.
</I>
No I don't use cinerama. As far as I understand, cinerama shows two
desktops at the same time - one desktop per screen, and allows dragging
windows from one desktop to another. My system, via the ATI control
panel app, uses one large desktop (2880x900) - spanning over two
monitors. So what I see, is actually one very wide desktop.

I believe that is why many apps (not just MSEide) display popup dialogs
etc centered between my displays. Luckily for any application that have
the ability to restore windows to the previously used position, this
isn't much of a problem.

Maybe I should activate cinerama for a few days and see if that doesn't
improve things for all applications.


&gt;<i> I can not test multi monitor setup on Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> because none of my Linux distributions can handle my video cards and monitors 
</I>&gt;<i> in a multi screen environment, I used several days for attempts, no 
</I>&gt;<i> success...
</I>
It took me just under an hour to set it up the way I like it (using
Ubuntu 10.04.1 with an ATI Radeon HD 4350 video card and the latest ATI
proprietary drivers). I'm now running the JWM window manager, instead of
the default Gnome desktop. Linux still has some room for improvement in
this [ease of use] department.

I must say though, it is a shame if you can't use a multi-monitor setup,
because for programming it works just brilliantly. IDE on one side,
running application on the other. I can step through code or watch the
application output, without any windows overlapping etc.. Or surf the
web in one monitor while the other monitor has my mail app running. I
don't think I ever want to use a single monitor again. :) One BIG HINT
though.... Make sure the monitors are the same size and resolution. This
works *much* better that an odd-sized monitor setup.

<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> That is part of the plan, but as always, I want to keep library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies as low as possible. I believe DirectFB is a library for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier access to the Linux Framebuffer (please correct me if I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only: + hardware acceleration + mouse + keyboard  input handling +  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL...

DirectFBSurface supports blitting, filling, drawing lines rects etc, but  
it does not support everything Qt allows you to do. E.g. painter paths,  
polygons, complex transformations, antialiasing, gradients. Some of these  
things are handled in newer versions of DirectFB and could be supported by  
Qt. They are seemingly optional at the driver level, so you need to have  
fall back code paths for older drivers and drivers on which this is not  
implemented.

The QDirectFBPaintEngine is a subclass of the QRasterPaintEngine, thus  
essentially supporting everything QRasterPaintEngine supports. This means  
that it supports all graphical operations that Qt supports, but certain  
operations will have to fall back to software rendering and that should be  
avoided due to performance issues. Instead, these operations should be  
rendered into a QPixmap once, and then reuse the pixmap.

Note: Fallbacks to software rendering should be avoided. If unsupported  
operations are used, the paint engine must fallback to the  
QRasterPaintEngine engine. A good debugging tip is to make Qt warn you  
when such fall backs occur, and to disable the fall back and only return.  
Debugging options are listed below.
DirectFB driver

DirectFB also provides an abstraction for keyboard and mouse drivers. This  
simplifies the process of getting the target hardware up and running. It  
also brings us to a feature fragmentation issue between different versions  
of DirectFB.

The Qt DirectFB driver currently supports DirectFB versions &gt;= 0.9. Still,  
there are large differences in what each actual implementation handles  
correctly. It is relatively common not to properly support DirectFB  
windows, so Qt needs to handle this case with a different code path. In  
addition, certain drivers do not properly support DirectFB's cursor  
handling. This means Qt has to have a code path for rendering the cursor  
itself when this is the case. Some drivers do not let us create  
preallocated surfaces which means we have to have a conditional code path  
for that case.

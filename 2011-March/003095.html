<PRE>Hallo Julio,

I.e., that is your job? Well, then you'd have the time available, of course.

&gt;<i> visual part of a program is also very important, from my point of view.

</I>
Well... creating some tiny pixel heaps with unrecognizable shape to mark
some control areas of unrelated function, as it often is, is certainly art
at its best...
And to put a critique above it - replacing the now customary &quot;kinked sheet&quot;
picture by a blurry all-blueish not-quite-rectangle that could mean
anything at all isn't really what I consider an enhancement of useability.
Not by far. Those &quot;silken&quot; icons you keep in such high esteem are much less
recognizable, not at all widely known, and require another round of getting
used to in addition of learning what the heck any of them might be meant to
stand for. Icons commonly aren't of any use if you don't know what
application they're used in and what they mean _in_ _this_ _specific_
_setting_. It can and _does_ differ, and there can be and are different
ones used for the same function

(Of course, you can view this as creating a new script system, just by
tinkering around with any number of signs and trying to attach meaning to
them, inconsistently and varyingly. It may be that, within a couple hundred
years, something mainly consistent and acknowledged might emerge, it may
also be that after some time of tinkering, the .tinkerers and the users
alike will get tired and this picturesque mark up system vanishes. We'll
have to see, I guess... ;)

&gt;<i> BTW, don't you care about the  look and feel of the programs? I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> important, form the users point of view.. of course the programs must do
</I>&gt;<i> their work fine, this is most important.
</I>
An application user interface has to clearly state what its controls will
do, I think. That's why I don't use icons a lot, it's challenging enough to
come up with those short snippets of text that fit in the available space
for any control. Restricting this space further by placing mysterious
micropictures there is mostly a waste of space. Noone can figure out what a
randomly selected icon might mean if it's for some special function of an
appliance. What immediately recognizable picture would you suggest, e.g.,
for a control to program the configuration of a microcontroller? Or to
increase the temperature setting of some heater? (The latter one should be
easy for you;)

Actually, Jean-Luc is simply using Open Source Anti-Grain Geometry for his
vector drawing... as is, curiously enough the nice folks at ACES (MS's Game
Studio) for much of their terrain drawing.* J-L simply wrapped up the
individual &quot;tools&quot; into a neat API and created some elegant functions with
them.

During my own extensive testing of the A-G 'toolset,' I've found that
well-optimized GDI+ drawing much faster overall than the same drawing being
performed by A-G. This isn't horribly surprising since at the end of all
the fiddly-bits being done, the entire screen you see in FSx (meaning any
version up till now) is being done by - get this! - plain vanilla GDI...

Where many programmers &quot;fall down&quot; using GDI+ is that they simply &quot;redraw&quot;
the entire gauge every cycle, instead of investing the time to optimize
individual elements of the drawing.

For example, does the &quot;bezel&quot; or other &quot;static elements&quot; ever change? Of
course not, that's why they're called &quot;static elements!&quot;  So, the
solution is to draw them ONCE, and save the image off screen...

Update ONLY those elements that change, and then only when they DO
change!!!

That said though, I must agree that on my system at least, the gauge set
for the Cheyenne are very, very slow, and kill my frame rate. Worse, the
variance is in the order of 30-50 fps, while a well-optimized set of
similar complexity should have less than 6 fps variance...

I have been using PowTils for years, and I am very satisfied.

It is rock steady and fast - and a big advantage as I see it is there is
no risk of memory leaks, as the compiled CGI program only runs once, and
then shuts down.

I have tried to stress test it the &quot;reverse way&quot; using the most
underpowered computer I could find in my piles of old junk, and even on
a 100mhz P2 with only some 64Meg memory, and an ooooold disk it was
running as a charm with 5+ users concurrently running an application
uploading data via web to a MySQL database on the same box.
Trying to make some request (database lookups) through the
webapplication was not noticeable influenced, despite the 5 uploads.

Unfortunately it seems like Lars have stopped developing PowTils, there
have been no activity on his website for years, and I never managed to
get access to the forum - but still the program as such is out there,
and it is still outstanding.

And if you are thinking about going that way, I have made an improved
session control, where the session is controlled in a MySQL database -
IMHO more reliable than built-in session control which sometimes could
lock if there were many users.

Different isn't necessarily a bad thing. :-)  DB-aware components
comes form the beginnings of Visual Basic, which Delphi simply copied
at the time. With every TDataset or linked field component you drop on
a form, that is one more more lock-in to a specific DB components
vendor and database schema.

Object Persistence Frameworks (any of them) are designed to clearly
separate your three layers: UI, Business Objects/Rules, and your
Storage layer. There is normall no business rules or SQL inside Form
units, business rules can easily be unit tested, and backend storage
(database or text file or something else) can easily be swapped out.
There is no binding to a specific db components vendor either. There
really are a lot of benefits to using a OPF instead of the old school
db-aware components.

tiOPF also has many true handy features too. A very nice logging
framework, many utility functions, built-in Visitor and Observer
(design patterns) support etc.

Fancy OPF's even support Object Query Language where you can write
something like &quot;select * from TCustomer where TCustomer.ID = xxx&quot;.
Note this is not SQL because you are referencing classes and
properties of those classes - not tables and fields. The OPF framework
will then translate that into the correct SQL for your specific
database backend. tiOPF supports some of this, but it still needs some
work.


&gt;<i> Is that to be understood that one can make one binary, in which all the
</I>&gt;<i> tiOFP stuff is included, connecting directly to the database?
</I>
A 3-tier setup is as follows. You have a Client application,
Application Server Application, and the Database Server. The client
application only speaks to the Application Server via HTTP, MIDAS,
WebServices, TCP Sockets etc. No database client libraries are
required because the Client application never talks to the Database
Server directly. The Application Server can sit on the same system as
the Client app, but normally it is not. The App Server is normally on
another system. The App Server system is the only one that requires
the database client libraries, because it talks to the database
server.

So when you deploy your client apps, it is normally just a small
executable with a setting telling it how to find the App Server. eg:
an IP address.


&gt;<i> I looked at MIDAS a long time ago, but in my opinion solutions like that
</I>
MIDAS worked very well, until you hit a problem. We used Delphi 5-7,
and with those versions of Delphi, there was no source code available
for MIDAS. So if you found a bug, there was no way to fix it, other
than hounding Borland to do it, and make a new MIDAS release. This was
rather hard to accomplish. That's one example of those &quot;vendor
lock-ins&quot; you must try and avoid.


&gt;<i> It seems like the KISS principle is totally forgotten when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> databases - imho the database should deliver what ever I ask it to
</I>
Well don't think for a second that DB-aware style programming is the
KISS principle. Such applications can very easily become a maintenance
nightmare. Here is a classic example of how a database module looked
like in a 12 year old Delphi application that I had to help maintain.

Where was *nothing* simple about it. :)

Anyway, I'm not saying OPF style database applications are for
everybody. But I like to at least inform people that there are very
viable alternatives to TDataset &amp; DB-aware components. Yes such RAD
style development looks great for the Borland/Embarcadero marketing
team and all their fish database demos - but they are not the ones
that need to develop and maintaing huge database applications for many
many years.

<PRE>Hi.

This is more like a kind of generic issue, but maybe some of you are
able to enlighten me a bit.

I want to make some database applications, and due to the license issues
with MySQL after Oracle have taken over, I am considering some
alternatives, it could be Firebird, Postgres, MariaDB og SQlite.

However all these databases requires the presence of an installed
library (libmysql.so, libsqlite.so etc) to be installed on the computer
running the program.

What I want to do is being able to distribute a selfcontained program
(or at the max distribute the program along with the library, which is
possible in Windows by having the .DLL file in same directory as the
program)
However this is not so simple on Linux, so I hope some of you can give
me some good ideas - currently I am primarily using MySQL, but my
intention for the future is more like doing two versions of my programs,
one for SQlite, and another (which can use 99% of the same codebase) for
MariaDB, thus stearing away from MySQL.

Of course there is still a licensing issue with MariaDB as they
currently are using the client library from MySQL, but Morthy claims
they are working on their own client.

An other way forward could be a native client, embedded into the
program, like AnyDAC or MyDAC, which are brilliant, but unfortunately
proprietary and only installable on Windos.

In general I am wondering why database clients are made that complicated
- as such it is up to the database server to deliver the results, so in
theory it should be fairly simple just to send the request over a
certain port and the expect the server to return the result (then one
can discuss whether this should encrypted or not, but that could be up
to one self to decide).

So from a priority point of view:

1. How do I embedd SQlite into a Free Pascal program?

2. Same with MySQL/MariaDB (look apart from the licensing issues)?

3. Does anyone have knowledge of some native libraryless components for
databases?


Regards
Christian

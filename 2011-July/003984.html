And what is the problem with that? Every report probably has a
different name, so simply base the class name on the report name.

I have many object instances in my applications, giving me no troubles
what so every. Objects as business objects, reports, mementos (undo
facility), menus, actions etc. Performance is brilliant (compared to
our previous version of the application which was written in Delphi
RAD-style). eg: We are a company producing Maths and Science tutoring
software. If I had to populate a treeview with all our exercises we
would have around 100 000 to 150 000 object instances. Obviously we
don't load the whole tree, we only load sections of the tree - as the
user navigates and expands nodes.


You too have many similar cases in your current software. Just look at
menu entries. Many many different names for each TMenuItem instance?
:<i>)  I really don't see what you are confused or complaining about,
</I>sorry.


&gt;<i> In my codes, I use DataSets but they are created dynamically. I do not

</I>
With Code Templates I don't have to do a lot of coding either.


&gt;<i> I prefer write my own SQL (for search). Just CRUD I do with something like OPF.
</I>
Same here, even for CRUD. I often load master/detail relationships
with a single visitor and a single sql statement. Yet the resulting
data are various List objects and Data objects.


&gt;<i> I talk about an explosion of names.
</I>
Neither Delphi nor FPC has a limitation on the amount of names you may
use for classes, identifiers etc. So what's the problem? Large
applications have large numbers of objects and identifier names, this
is normal. Your IDE of choice might just auto-generate those names for
you without you actually paying attention to them. Easy examples of
this are TMenuItem instances or TField instances.

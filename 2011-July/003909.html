Yes, and it's at least that bad.

&gt;<i> editor, simply setting the tab stop gap to 8 spaces gives you near
</I>&gt;<i> identical results.
</I>
Well - according to the Web site, no. If a tab was used to align, it _will_
be shown as wide as the editor used is set to show it. This will lead to
indentations differing from the intended display, either too shallow or
too deep.

&gt;<i> identical results. That's if you used tabs only for indentation,
</I>&gt;<i> alignment of text is another story.
</I>
With this, well, yes, that _is_ another story. Your program text will
look mangled thoroughly, like if you wrote something in a word processor,
aligning everything painstakingly by inserting spaces (which people indeed
do quite often), and then display it in another editor using some completly
different or even a monospaced font.

&gt;<i> This is just wrong! ET enabled editors allows the user to adjust the
</I>&gt;<i> indentation and alignment gaps at will. Text will always look correct
</I>
Not so - the initial indentation might be set &quot;at will&quot; (although this is
not explicitly mentioned in the text on the Web site), but so aligned
passages of text farther to the right will shift left or right according to
what you might type in one line in front of the group. And there may be
several groups which might be aligned independently of each other, though
the example avoids to show how they would be affected.
That would even be different from how a word processor handles this, as in
a word processor, tab stops are set at _fixed_ _positions_, not relative to
some text entered somewhere else. That way, as word processors commonly
implement it, is the &quot;real intention&quot; (if any) of tab stops: to allow
pieces of text to be set at specific, adjustable, positions on a line, like
it was done on any ol' typewriter, being the arch implementation of a word
processing machine.

&gt;<i> with any ET enabled editor - even if indentation width settings are
</I>&gt;<i> different between users. Read the ET website to fully understand how ET
</I>
That's nowhere stated on the Web site. The indentation depth is even said
to be individually configurable: &quot;different developers on the same team can
use tabs with fixed tabstops of whatever size they like as long as no one
tries to line up text for anything other than indentation&quot;. And that's
exactly what I did refer to, &quot;as long as no one tries to line up text for
anything other than indentation&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; And beware of mixing TABs and spaces for indentation!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is common sense and applies to any editor, not just ET enabled ones.
</I>
That's not really too bad with monospace fonts and the commonly used tab
size of 8 - but you're right here that even _then_ there are editors which
count character positions from 0 and will tab to positions 8, 16..., and
there are ones that count from 1 and will _also_ tab to positions 8, 16...,
which can also disrupt any alignment attempted by use of tab characters.

&gt;<i> &gt; to recognize your writings if you ever changed your settings, or have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use a different editor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 9/10 times developers will use the same editor for the same project.
</I>&gt;<i> over and over. So they shouldn't have a problem with editors, because
</I>&gt;<i> they will almost always use the same editor. This point is moot.
</I>
Oh, I didn't realize yet that it is a _requirement_ for programmers to
stick to one and only editor, even for different projects, and using
different languages. Did you tell the compiler vendors already?
Editors aren't even ASCII compatible, not even on Windows, and there are
many programmers using Linux for doing their work, even though the
resulting code is to run on Windows...
I, too, _got to_ work with different editors for different languages on
_one_ project several times already, and even had to use editors which
were not even compatible concerning common tab characters.

&gt;<i> files are saved, all tabs characters are replaced with spaced to try and
</I>&gt;<i> match the indentation and alignment. When the file is loaded again, the
</I>&gt;<i> reverse is done. All on the fly.
</I>
Ok, _that_ way it might even be workable, although this forgoes the
possibility you mentioned to reduce text size by insertion of tab
characters instead of spaces. It will also forgo the automatic alignment
adaptation between &quot;different developers on the same team&quot; who have set
their preferred indentation depth differently. (The editor _might_ try a
heuristic to recognize a possibly intended indentation here, but there
_will_ be cases where it will fail.)
For monospaced fonts, which are commonly used for program writing, exporting
shouldn't even be overly difficult. It only leaves the problem of aligning
comments or other text behind previous text on the same line - as desired by
the _writer_, not as prescribed by the text processing engine.
It will be a challenge of a different quality if one attempted to do this
for proportional fonts, as suggested on the Web site.

&gt;<i> &gt; Thus, if this feature should be considered for implementation, it should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strongly be considered to make it _optional_, and to make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _disabled_.by default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously.
</I>
Indeed.

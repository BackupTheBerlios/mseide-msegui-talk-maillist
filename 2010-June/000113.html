Correct. Workaround: use Gmane NNTP gateway.

I don't think there is a Email-address necessary in order to fetch NNTP
messages. It is necessary for posting messages only.

</I>&gt;<i> non-standard, judging from the fact that my mailer has a secial setup for

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The Email address you use in your NNTP identity and the mails sent to
berliOS and Gmane is not registered at berliOS and I had to approve your
message manually.

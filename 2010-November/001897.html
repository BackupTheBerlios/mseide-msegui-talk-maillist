<PRE>Hallo Graeme,

Du schriebst am Tue, 16 Nov 2010 09:44:21 +0200:

&gt;<i> Yes I understand that. What the Wayland developers was trying to say is

Not neccessarily, right. But _if_ it is there, there are a lot of things
that cannot be done otherwise.

&gt;<i> actually needed. OS-X, Windows, BeOS, etc etc. doesn't have such &quot;network

</I>
Yes, crutches that allow one user - usually an adimistrative one - to gain
access to another one's desktop, provided his screen is large enough to
accommodate the other's screen. If not, well, he's in trouble if he needs
to access something out of his reach...

&gt;<i> VirtualBox manages to do something like what you want. Normally it's a

</I>
Well, I didn't say I'd _want_ this. Actually, I usually use Virtualbox in
desktop mode, mainly because the integration mode windows are so slow.
And above that, they're even then restricted to the dimensions of the host
virtual screen size, even if it's invisible. Not to mention the artefacts
occurring on moving or resizing such a window - at least on a machine like
mine, which &quot;only&quot; has a 2.6GHz CPU (single core) and 1.5GBytes of main
memory (running openbox, of course). I would _not_ dare to use this over a
network with less than 1Gbit/s and call it &quot;usable&quot;.

&gt;<i> desktop. So there must be a way this same idea can be applied in Wayland.
</I>
This is _not_ a feature of the window manager, but one of the network
&quot;hijacker&quot; program - it needs to run as a system service with high
privilege, so it can get access to all of the information about the active
windows to be able to copy their contents and frames and, very important,
to know of changes to them to report.

&gt;<i> Again without needing the client/server approach X11 currently has. I
</I>
Nope. The &quot;hijacker&quot; programs put a client-server layer _above_ the already
running display server. You think this is a more efficient approach?

&gt;<i> think this is the point the Wayland developers was trying to make. X11 was
</I>&gt;<i> designed decades ago with much less technology and slower networks,
</I>&gt;<i> compared to today.
</I>
Yes, and it achieved even then a performance that VNC e.g. needs a machine
of around tenfold the hardware power available then to do comparably. Did
you try to run your window manager through a network connection directly
(ssh X-forwarding, or even plain Xhost (I think it is) protocol over tcp
and compare that with a VNC connection to the same machine?

&gt;<i> &gt; No icons, no taskbar, no context menues, no &quot;applets&quot;, nothing that may

I _don't_ _like_ a taskbar. I don't want to have to have one.

</I>
Ooopps - XML, clear text encryption? XML is so bloated and unreadable that
it is best treated as an encrypted binary format. Which means that you need
special programs to create and maintain the pertinent files.
(Unfortunately, openbox _also_ uses an XML format file for configuration
and menus, albeit a very simple form of it for the menu file. And they do
_not_ carry a checksum to &quot;protect&quot; against direct manual changes.)

&gt;<i> right-click and select reload, to reload JWM without restarting X11.
</I>&gt;<i> Awesome! :)
</I>
Not at all - this used to be the common way for reconfiguration, even
changing the window manager, formerly. Why'd you want to restart the
drawing engine (X server), if all you changed are some settings for an
application (window manager)?
They're going to far extremes abusing their tools nowadays, it seems...

<PRE>Hallo Graeme,

&gt;<i> I often developer remotely via Linux RDP client to a Windows Server. Oh

And what happens to the display on the other side then? Does _your_ RDP
client have the remote server override the local settings? I'd expect that.

&gt;<i> desktop simply adjusts its resolution accordingly. This is pretty neat,
</I>
Ah, I see - the remote server _does_ override its local settings. So the
remote user - if there is one, which doesn't seem to be the case in your
case - would be in trouble then to watch what's been done to his machine...

[VirtualBox]
&gt;<i> I have never seen this, and I use VirtualBox via a remote server as well -
</I>
You probabely run it in full screen mode then, with resolution matching
your local screen. I just used the windowed display, and this didn't even
allow to switch to &quot;seamless mode&quot; before everything was up and running and
I had loggend in...

&gt;<i> to maintain the server. We only have a 100Mbs network.
</I>
Maybe with the preconditions assumed above, it can work somewhat more
efficiently (doesn't have to care about clipping), but when I tested that
yesterday (using the latest Virtualbox version downloaded only a couple
days ago), I saw gross lagging effects on the trailing side of windows
moved about, and clipping on the leading edges. But you might have already
adjusted your setup so these artefacts don't occur (so drastically).
I would surmise that the &quot;traditional&quot; Windows display for moving windows,
an empty hatched frame, will not show these effects; I have mine set to
show the full window contents even when moving - wouldn't any user want to
do that on a current machine? BTW, what machine are you using? Perhaps my
suspicion was wrong that network speed would be the limiting factor, and it
is drawing performance or even access to screen memory in fact.

&gt;<i> &gt; Not at all - this used to be the common way for reconfiguration, even
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this too, but haven't seen it in modern window manager or desktop
</I>&gt;<i> environments (Gnome, KDE, XFCE etc). Last time I saw this was years ago
</I>&gt;<i> when I still used FVWM2.
</I>
Openbox can do it, AFAIK the whole series of &lt;anything&gt;box window managers
does it, and some others can do it, too.
But you're right that none of the &quot;desktop environments&quot; is able to do
this, more specifically, none of their window managers. They're probabely
more prone to provide bothering functions, like needless information
windows (&quot;you just inserted a memory stick&quot;... _I know that!_), &quot;eye candy&quot;
or yet another implementation of an automounter (which cannot be used
without and external to them) instead of utilizing the available
convenience functions.
That's evidently what some people regard as progress these days...

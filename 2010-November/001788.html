I see this inconsistent too. But all others developers do not see it?
Not exists people working with LCL in production with sucess?
Strange...

&gt;<i> Yes initially LCL's &quot;it's so close to Delphi&quot; wins over a few developers,

</I>&gt;<i> in any of our applications code. This is true &quot;single source, compile
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere&quot;! And the end-user experiences consistent behaviour across all
</I>&gt;<i> platforms.
</I>
I agree. Without IFDEF is the true &quot;single source, compile
everywhere&quot;. But I don't understand why we have some options for
widgets. Should be just one! The community would be more united (the
community Pascal is &quot;weak&quot; compared to others languages).

I don't understand why LCL use IFDEF. Maybe to be compatible with Delphi?
I don't understand why you created other option to widgets... why did
you not use the MSEgui?
And, finally, I don't understand why all you (Graeme, Martin, Lazarus
team, etc) do not join to create a better product!

I think most of those users only use LCL apps on a single platform, or
only use it as a &quot;toy&quot; (and doesn't get much real world use).


&gt;<i> I don't understand why LCL use IFDEF. Maybe to be compatible with Delphi?

Simply because they are trying to do the impossible. They are chasing
a moving target: Microsoft stops for nobody, Apple stops for nobody,
Qt keeps changing and improving etc. Yet they want a single API across
all those frameworks and platform targets.... wishful thinking, and
explains why they have so many bugs.


&gt;<i> I don't understand why you created other option to widgets... why did
</I>&gt;<i> you not use the MSEgui?
</I>&gt;<i> And, finally, I don't understand why all you (Graeme, Martin, Lazarus
</I>&gt;<i> team, etc) do not join to create a better product!
</I>
I initially started with a discontinued fpGUI (development stopped
back in 2000, and I started in 2004/5... the original fpGUI was
actually started before Lazarus even existed). Then later I found some
design problems and I started with a total rewrite of fpGUI. Only then
did I hear about MSEgui. Yes I looked at MSEgui, and was very
impressed with its feature list, but I found it very hard to learn,
very hard to read, we had different design ideas, and Martin has very
strong idea of what he does and doesn't want MSEgui to be (single
developer with total control - which he has all the right to have).
Too many uphill battles for me and I already made a bad choice in our
company in letting us go with LCL at first, so didn't want to make
another &quot;potential&quot; bad mistake (which could cost me my job). So it
was simply easier for me to continue working on fpGUI, and design it
for our company needs. fpGUI fits somewhere between VCL and MSEgui.
More flexible that VCL and not as different as MSEgui, so I think
easier to learn [Martin will disagree here :-)]. So fpGUI is more in
line with what I and our other in-house developers was used to. fpGUI
has a slight VCL class style and structure (after all, I used Delphi
for many years), but without the VCL binding to native controls and
being very Windows centric.

Martin on the other hand took a total different approach with MSEgui,
but he can explain that, and his reasonings, better than I.

The big difference between MSEgui and fpGUI, compared to LCL, is that
we are NOT trying to be VCL clones. We come up with our own ideas and
solutions, or borrow ideas from various other frameworks, to build an
even better framework.

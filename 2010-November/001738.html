</I>
The problem with LCL's approach is that on the surface it looks all great.
But when you put it in a commercial/production environment, it falls over
pretty fast. We initially tried to use LCL in our commercial software for a
year and a bit. Most of the things we wanted to do worked different on each
platform or wasn't possible on certain platforms but was on others, so our
code started containing IFDEF Linux.... IFDEF Windows....  This defeats the
whole purpose of a &quot;cross-platform framework&quot;. OK, this was 5 years ago,
and the Lazarus team has probably fixed some of those issues, but many
still remain, and the LCL is just plain unstable. What works today is
broken tomorrow. Even inside the IDE itself, some windows work different on
various platforms, or even on the same platform but with different gui
toolkit backends. &quot;Procedure List&quot; window is just one such example of many.
One just can't code applications with such issues - it is too inconsistent.

Yes initially LCL's &quot;it's so close to Delphi&quot; wins over a few developers,
but it's definitely not production ready. In the long run, LCL gives more
grief that solutions.

For this reason our company opted to go fully custom written/drawn, and we
started working on fpGUI. We now use fpGUI for all our commercial products
and internal software. We don't have a single IFDEF Linux...IFDEF Windows
in any of our applications code. This is true &quot;single source, compile
everywhere&quot;! And the end-user experiences consistent behaviour across all
platforms.

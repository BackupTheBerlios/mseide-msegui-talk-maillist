I don't understand why they do that... I don't have much time even to
work in my company, imagine if I would use a software as a &quot;toy&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't understand why LCL use IFDEF. Maybe to be compatible with Delphi?

</I>
Yes, that is it.
Even I, who entered the &quot;world of FreePascal&quot; now, I can see it ...
how the FPC team can not see it?

&gt;<i> I initially started with a discontinued fpGUI (development stopped
</I>&gt;<i> back in 2000, and I started in 2004/5... the original fpGUI was
</I>&gt;<i> actually started before Lazarus even existed). Then later I found some
</I>&gt;<i> design problems and I started with a total rewrite of fpGUI. Only then
</I>&gt;<i> did I hear about MSEgui. Yes I looked at MSEgui, and was very
</I>&gt;<i> impressed with its feature list, but I found it very hard to learn,
</I>&gt;<i> very hard to read, we had different design ideas, and Martin has very
</I>&gt;<i> strong idea of what he does and doesn't want MSEgui to be (single
</I>&gt;<i> developer with total control - which he has all the right to have).
</I>&gt;<i> Too many uphill battles for me and I already made a bad choice in our
</I>&gt;<i> company in letting us go with LCL at first, so didn't want to make
</I>&gt;<i> another &quot;potential&quot; bad mistake (which could cost me my job). So it
</I>&gt;<i> was simply easier for me to continue working on fpGUI, and design it
</I>&gt;<i> for our company needs. fpGUI fits somewhere between VCL and MSEgui.
</I>&gt;<i> More flexible that VCL and not as different as MSEgui, so I think
</I>&gt;<i> easier to learn [Martin will disagree here :-)]. So fpGUI is more in
</I>&gt;<i> line with what I and our other in-house developers was used to. fpGUI
</I>&gt;<i> has a slight VCL class style and structure (after all, I used Delphi
</I>&gt;<i> for many years), but without the VCL binding to native controls and
</I>&gt;<i> being very Windows centric.
</I>
Ok. So, the fpGUI is not just a better vision of widgets but also a
way to work in your company.
If you knew the MSEgui before it had begun fpGUI, maybe you and Martin
were working together.  ;-)

&gt;<i> Martin on the other hand took a total different approach with MSEgui,
</I>&gt;<i> but he can explain that, and his reasonings, better than I.
</I>
Rigth.

&gt;<i> The big difference between MSEgui and fpGUI, compared to LCL, is that
</I>&gt;<i> we are NOT trying to be VCL clones. We come up with our own ideas and
</I>&gt;<i> solutions, or borrow ideas from various other frameworks, to build an
</I>&gt;<i> even better framework.
</I>
I think is a good ideia keep compatibility with Delphi using LCL, but
I don't think this should be a default solution for FPC/Lazarus; maybe
a separate project.

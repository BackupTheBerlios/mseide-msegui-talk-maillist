<PRE>Hallo IvankoB,

&gt;<i> &gt; Must be clairvoyant software that can reconstruct destroyed data.

&gt;<i> These settings are standardized but they're many so the tool writers
</I>&gt;<i> just make a lot of excellent job.
</I>
Well, if they're standard, they don't need to be stored, and if they're
need to be stored, they cannot be standard any more - so there should be no
tool needed?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And it found several rootkits after Avira then KAV then DrWeb !

</I>&gt;<i> It was by my mistake :) And the virused machine wasn't my machine :)
</I>
Never mind. I didn't realize it wasn't your machine. But still, you should
be on the watch for yet unclosed malware.

&gt;<i> &gt; With Linuxers, the usual process in such a case is to save all user
</I>...
&gt;<i> You're right ! Linux apps are usually store all configs in user home  
</I>&gt;<i> directory &amp; use text config files.
</I>
Still most of the programs do, but with the advent of the &quot;big&quot; desktop
environments like KDE and gnome, this seems to be eroded fast. Newer
software increasingly uses other storage methods, probabely to &quot;protect&quot;
the settings from curious users. Thus, it becomes increasingly common that
in case of some problem, one has to reinstall the software. Reminiscence of
unwieldy experiences...

&gt;<i> &gt; 		Happy Christmas!
</I>
Thanks, same to you!

&gt;<i> And Happy becoming New Year to everybody ! Our  city is all dressed in
</I>&gt;<i> the cristman's trees :)
</I>&gt;<i> Which are illuminated once twilights. So nice!
</I>
Well - this takes on threatening dimensions around here already.
It's just not that bad as in a story I received a couple of years ago;
I try to provide a (crude) translation of it below (I hope you enjoy it
anyway... ;-)

(BTW, the &quot;Adventskranz&quot; is an old german custom, a wreath wound from fir
twigs and decorated with 4 candles, one for each of the four Advent sundays,
which are lit in succession on each of these sundays.)


A modern Advent story: 

Sunday, 1st of Advent, 10 o'clock: 
  In the settlement Oenkelstieg the elderly lady Erna B. has her grandson
  Norbert install three electrical candles on the window sill of her
  living room. A mood of Christmas expectation spreads, and there is a
  lot of happiness. 

10 o'clock 14 minutes: 
  While emptying the garbage pail neighbour Ottfried P. observes this
  provoking Christmas offensive in the neighboring house and immediately
  counters with  the placement of the 10-armed Danish candle set with
  15 Watts each in his kitchen window. A couple hours later the entire
  settlement Oenkelstieg is lit up in the peaceful light of 134 electrical
  window decorations. 

19 o'clock 03 minutes: 
  At the coal-fired power station Sottrup Hoecklage 14 kilometers away,
  the service engineer of duty erroneously registers a defect of the power
  meters for the area Stenkelfeld north, but at first stays unsuspecting. 

20 o'clock 17 minutes: 
  The married couple Horst and Heidi E succeed with the installation of
  a daisy chain network of 96 halogen film lights across all trees of their
  orchard, connected to the three-phase grid. Parts of the domestic bird
  world confusedly begin with the building of nests.

20 o'clock 56 minutes: 
  The discotheque owner Alfons K. sees himself forced to contribute his
  part to the Christmas mood and installs the laser ensemble Metropolis,
  ranging among the highest performance ones of Europe, onto his bungalow's
  flat roof. The 40 meters high front of an adjacent grain silo withstands
  the sustained fire of the Father Christmas projection for several minutes
  before crumbling down with a nasty noise.

21 o'clock 30 minutes: 
  In the excitement of a Julklapp celebration in the coal-fired power
  station Sottrup Hoecklage the warning signal from generator hall 5
  resounds unheard. 

21 o'clock 50 minutes: 
  85 year old war veteran August R. manages by means of 815 anti aircraft
  spotlights of type &quot;Varta Volkssturm&quot; to project the star of Bethlehem
  onto the low-hanging cloud cover. 

22 o'clock 12 minutes: 
  A group of Asian businessmen with light luggage and summer clothing
  scaredly errs about the settlement Oenkelstieg. 
  Before, a Boeing 747 of Singapore airlines with destination Sydney had
  landed mistakenly on the driveway of baker Broermeyer's garage, paved
  with 3.000 multicolored neon tubes.

22 o'clock 37 minutes: 
  NASA space probe Voyager 7 transmits pictures from the edge of the Milky
  Way of an alleged supernova on the earth's northern hemisphere.
  The experts in Houston are clueless.

22 o'clock 50 minutes: 
  A light earthquake shakes the environment of the coal-fired power station
  Sottrup Hoecklage. The entire complex with its 30 turbines runs roaring
  at 350 megawatts beyond its power limit.

23 o'clock 06 minutes: 
  In the daybright illuminated settlement Oenkelstieg the student Bettina
  U. awakes and erroneously enjoys the sunny December morning. At exactly
  12 minutes past 23 o'clock she turns on the switch of her coffee machine.

23 o'clock 12 minutes and 14 seconds: 
  Into the sudden darkness of the entire district Stenkelfeld breaks the
  explosion of the power station Sottrup Hoecklage like resounding thunder.
  Through the night-dark settlement err distracted humans. Humans like you
  and me, who were not satisfied by a candle on the Adventskranz!

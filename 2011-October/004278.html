<PRE>Hallo Graeme,

Du schriebst am Tue, 04 Oct 2011 09:16:13 +0200:

&gt;<i> Maybe it's worth setting up your own hosting server and domain name like
</I>
You might still be better off using a hoster-based (virtual) server - they
are said to be quite affordable these days now. You get some (limited)
maintenance, at least regular back-ups, and do away with the need to keep
the thing going around the clock all days (and have a static [unchangeable]
IP address, too).

&gt;<i> one of those cheap embedded PC's that should be more than powerful
</I>
If they are &quot;real&quot; PCs, and the load - also depending on (number of)
services provided - won't become to high.

BTW, This below:

&gt;<i> There is a non-profit organization in the UK developing an ARM based PC
</I>
is _not_ a real PC, you even said it above. It is an embedded computer card
using a very non-PCish CPU - ARM - which will _not_ run any regular PC
operating system. You won't be able to run a Windows XP, Vista or 7 on it,
the latest Windows system available for ARM is Windows CE (AFAIK).
You cannot run one of the common Linux distributions on it. You will need a
special ARM version of the system, and although they exist, you most
probabely will have to build and maintain it yourself. You will also have
to build and maintain all applications yourself, and don't count on that
they will port 1:1 to this processor - you might have to do quite some bug
hunting and patching here.

&gt;<i> I think this device has HUGE potential in our Master Maths/Science
</I>
Probabely so, it will be an excellent &quot;educational&quot; tool. It might also
make a good small volume / single piece embedded system core. But it will
not be a plug-and-play PC replacement by any means.

&gt;<i> centres. A really small PC with no movable parts, thus very robust. It
</I>
You can get &quot;real&quot; PC boards of similar structure (featuring an intel or
AMD processor and other common PC components) also - and these will be far
easier to use for someone not involved with developing a special device, as
they can be set up with most any installation-ready operating system
available.

&gt;<i> has rather fast processing power (as you can see from the video clips),
</I>&gt;<i> and is dirt cheap! Simply duck-tape the Rasberry Pi &quot;pc&quot; to the back of
</I>&gt;<i> a LCD monitor, and you have your own homebru &quot;iMac clone&quot; for a fraction
</I>&gt;<i> of the cost. :-)
</I>
No. Quite simply, no.

&gt;<i> Specifications:
</I>&gt;<i>     * 700MHz ARM11
</I>
How slow a KDE or gnome desktop can you stand? You will hate it.

&gt;<i>     * 128MB or 256MB of SDRAM
</I>
This guarantees heavy swapping activities with anything memory intensive.
Forget firefox.

&gt;<i>     * SD/MMC/SDIO memory card slot
</I>
Will not survive swapping activity for very long.

&gt;<i>     * General-purpose I/O
</I>
What purpose supported out of the box?

&gt;<i>     * Optional integrated 2-port USB hub and 10/100 Ethernet controller
</I>&gt;<i>     * Open software (Ubuntu, Iceweasel, KOffice, Python)
</I>                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I doubt _very_ _heavily_ that these will be usable on this device...
One firefox instance (iceweasel _is_ firefox) will fill up all of the
available memory by itself, even on the 256MB version. It will work, but it
will _not_ _run_.

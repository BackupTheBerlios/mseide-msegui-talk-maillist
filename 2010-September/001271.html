<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Wed, 29 Sep 2010 08:03:25 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt; One gripe found as far: The tabwidget doesn't allow to hide the tabs any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more, at least not easily and without tricks...
</I>...
&gt;<i> Disable tab_optionswidget1 ow1_autoheight.
</I>
I think I _did_ try this already, and it didn't work - but I might not also
have set the height value to 0 as well.
Well, now it did work, kind of, at least.

Could it be the case that there are a couple of inconsistencies left?
There were several occasions now when some value I had changed appeared
with the _old_ value again after compilation, and the compiled program did
not show like the new value had been used at all.

And just right now, after having changed the tab height field, I got an
error message &quot;Can not read form file &quot;...&quot;. Error reading
Seitenwahl.tab_fontactivetab.shadow_color: Access violation&quot;!
I didn't even _look up_ this value!

And upon trying to move the error message dialog to the workspace where I'm
typing this, the message window got lost (could not shift it over) and the
IDE locked up, after having closed the source window (only). The only way
to get rid of it was an &quot;xkill&quot; application to it, as it wouldn't even
respond to a window manager close command. I could even reproduce this
another time: shifting the error message (which _did_ reappear after
reloading, so the error became even saved to the .mfm file) to another work
space loses the window, on switching back the source window is gone and the
IDE locked up.
As to the error message, removing the field mentioned just shifted the
failure to the next entry - until all occurences of &quot;tab_fontactivetab&quot;
were gone. Thereafter, the .mfm file could be reshown as form again.
Could that have been caused because I _had_ set a specific font there (and
for the &quot;fonttab&quot; field also), but removed it just before? (I think I just
removed &quot;fonttab&quot; and not &quot;fontactivetab&quot;.)
Possibly it was not removed completely internally, and an ensuing
recompilation resurrected part of it, but messed up something else doing so?

Well, now everything seems to be in best order again, so I can no longer
find out more about these interesting (but unwieldy) &quot;effects&quot;... ;-&gt;

BTW, the focus behaviour of the IDE is somewhat, err, unusual, as to say.
It does not really yield to another window made active by means of the
window manager. if the mouse cursor still sits within its reach, even if
the other window would normally get into possession of the mouse after
activation. I have to shift the mouse cursor into the window of interest to
heave that on top, although this should normally not be neccessary.

This effect occurs even among the IDE windows alone, and switching between
them redraws all affected windows several times, hiding and reshowing parts
of them in rapid succession, like the IDE was undecided what to really
prefer now....
It also occurred several times that I wasn't able to bring the main (menu)
window into the foreground, when it was covered partly by the component
palette - this would even stay in the foreground when it was _not_ active.

Most of these effects, BTW, did _not_ occur with the previous version(s),
where the editor also had the old behaviour of &quot;jumping&quot; to the nearest
word begin whether forward or backward. The new behaviour is really
awkward, always jumping to the _farthest_ end of the nearest word.
I _heartily_ _dislike_ it so. And it is _not_ configurable!
I consider switching to Lazarus because of this...  ;-&gt;

Sorry for the lengthy sermon...

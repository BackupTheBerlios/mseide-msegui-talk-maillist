</I>Access violations should never happen. :-)
Steps to reproduce? An assumption is that something went wrong while reading
the old *.mfm where the tab properties are stored differently. Not well
tested probably...

&gt;<i> And upon trying to move the error message dialog to the workspace where
</I>&gt;<i> I'm typing this, the message window got lost ....
</I>
After an AV you should close MSEide immediately because there is a big risk
that it has become unstable.

&gt;<i> BTW, the focus behaviour of the IDE is somewhat, err, unusual, as to say.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not really yield to another window made active by means of the
</I>&gt;<i> window manager. if the mouse cursor still sits within its reach, even if
</I>&gt;<i> the other window would normally get into possession of the mouse after
</I>&gt;<i> activation. I have to shift the mouse cursor into the window of interest
</I>&gt;<i> to heave that on top, although this should normally not be neccessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>If the pointer moves from outside in the area of the main menu and MSEide
has the focus the main menu window will be brought to front in order all
items are visible. Another Openbox effect maybe?
It is possible to switch off Z-order handling with the comand line
parameter --NOZORDERHANDLING.

&gt;<i> Most of these effects, BTW, did _not_ occur with the previous version(s),
</I>&gt;<i> where the editor also had the old behaviour of &quot;jumping&quot; to the nearest
</I>&gt;<i> word begin whether forward or backward. The new behaviour is really
</I>&gt;<i> awkward, always jumping to the _farthest_ end of the nearest word.
</I>&gt;<i> I _heartily_ _dislike_ it so. And it is _not_ configurable!
</I>
Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right? It has been changed on repeatedly user request and I
find it logical. If the cursor is in the middle of a word Ctrl+Left jumps
to left word border, Ctrl+Right to the right.

&gt;<i> I consider switching to Lazarus because of this...  ;-&gt;
</I>
Feel free to do so. :-)

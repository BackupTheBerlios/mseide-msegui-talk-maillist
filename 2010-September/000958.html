<PRE>Hallo Martin,

Du schriebst am Tue, 07 Sep 2010 19:57:46 +0200:

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The settings could be done with an &quot;options&quot; property, I'll have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; look.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That would be fine and possibly useful for others too - and what do you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think about the new &quot;feature&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is useful although it probably could be achieved with tchart
</I>
That's certainly right, and it was a posibility I pondered also, especially
as that would have been nearly what I had implemented already.

&gt;<i> too. tchart does not use bitmap scrolling so it needs more CPU than
</I>&gt;<i> tchartrecorder for a moving time window.
</I>
That's a neat trick to save quite an amount of memory and processing. Also,
you used a variation on Bresenham's line drawing algorithm to smooth out the
positioning errors during drawing, I saw. I tried to not break these
features by adding the &quot;sweep&quot; modification.

&gt;<i> Grid behind the traces requires a pixmap with alpha channel, it should be
</I>&gt;<i> feasible.
</I>
I'm not really sure how the grid is produced - it seems to be drawn onto
the - a secondary - bitmap after the curves have been refreshed. So the
main curve bitmap would have to be the one having the alpha property, so
the background, where the grid was drawn, would not be changed on refresh?
This implies, though, that there had to be _3_ bitmaps, then: one for the
curves, one for the grid, and one for combining them for display - correct?
Or do you constantly redraw the grid on the display bitmap, after the curve
bitmap was copied? Then the grid redraw had to be moved to occur before
copying the curves.
(That's about what I did with my self made solution, except that I had the
grid drawn before the curves, which were also redrawn on each iteration
from data arrays - like the solution using a chart that you mentioned. It
did work quite well, but the way I had done it, it had no buffering, and I
had not implemented an X grid (yet).)
